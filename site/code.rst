My first language was Python. My current passion is for functional programming
languages, especially Haskell and Clojure.

I've written code for small startups, for a large investment bank, and now for
a company that does computational bio-chemistry.

My Github repo is `here <https://github.com/christopheryoung/>`_.

An old Bitbucket repo is `here <https://bitbucket.org/chrisyoung/>`_.

My dotfiles, including my beloved .emacs, are on Github `here <https://github.com/christopheryoung/dotfiles>`_

The code that generates this site is `also on Github <https://github.com/christopheryoung/chrisyoung>`_.
