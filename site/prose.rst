**Essays, etc.**

I taught at the University level for several years, and retain a strong
interest in pedagogy. One product of this interest is my essay, "How to Teach
'Introduction to Applied Ethics', " the latest version of which can be found
`here </prose/essays/how-to-teach-introduction-to-applied-ethics/>`_.

A work in progress: My bibliographical essay on `resources in computational stemmatology</reading/computational-stemmatology.html>`_.

After reading about, and teaching a little, applied game theory, I designed a
card game which is essentially a series of nested, iterated prisoner's
dilemmas. You can find a description of the game `here </prose/essays/miser/>`_.
