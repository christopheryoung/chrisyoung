My rarely updated personal blog, *Notes and Queries* is `here </prose/blog/>`_

For several years I ran a group blog devoted to politics, books, etc., called
`explananda <http://explananda.com>`_.

I taught at the University level for several years, and retain a strong
interest in pedagogy. One product of this interest is my essay, "How to Teach
'Introduction to Applied Ethics', " the latest version of which can be found
`here
</prose/essays/how-to-teach-introduction-to-applied-ethics.html>`_.

After reading about, and teaching a little, applied game theory, I designed a
card game which is essentially a series of nested, iterated prisoner's
dilemmas. You can find a description of the game `here <prose/essays/miser.html>`_.
