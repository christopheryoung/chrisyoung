	but as a philosophical writers and teacher." (p. 173) L thinks this
	because he thinks that VII hints that it was Archytas who taught
	Dionysius II philosophy and gave him the idea that he knew it all.
	
	
	
	L tends to doubt the authenticity of VII, but doesn't insist on it.
	He does think that one of the functions of VII is to get Plato off
	on the charge of plagiarizing Pythagorean material. Who might have
	suggested that? L doesn't know, though he speculates that it might
	have been Aristoxenus (170-171)
