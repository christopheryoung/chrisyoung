  abstract = {Lloyd argues that, contrary to the popular view, Archytas comes in
	for a rough treatment in the Seventh Letter. Although he gets credit
	for Plato's rescue, "[t]he Archytas presented here comes out of the
	presentation with a poor score at best not just as a judge of character,
	but as a philosophical writers and teacher." (p. 173) L thinks this
	because he thinks that VII hints that it was Archytas who taught
	Dionysius II philosophy and gave him the idea that he knew it all.



	L tends to doubt the authenticity of VII, but doesn't insist on it.
	He does think that one of the functions of VII is to get Plato off
	on the charge of plagiarizing Pythagorean material. Who might have
	suggested that? L doesn't know, though he speculates that it might
	have been Aristoxenus (170-171)


	Notes: Awfully speculative, though clever.},

	be objects recalled, imagined, dreamt or thought, thereby avoiding
	a Platonic two-world epistemology and ensuring continuity between
	human and animal experience. But De anima 3.3 offers no formal theory
	of phantasia, it merely distinguishes it from two adjacent phenomena
	(perception and thought) by mentioning factors that fail to fit.
	The factors differ with the contrast being drawn, and detail functions
	typical but not definitive of phantasia--which emerges as a capacity
	to absorb and recall forms once perceived, providing a resource for
	manifold cognitive faculties in animals and humans.},

 abstract = {The originals of ancient literary works gave rise to copies. These manuscripts were often copied in turn; often, too, manuscripts eventually perished. The editor of an ancient work must consider the relations among the manuscripts, extant and lost, which transmitted the text, and the structure of such manuscript populations in general. For example, most family-trees reconstructed by editors for the manuscripts of ancient works show exactly two main branches; is this to be expected, or due to some flaw in methods of reconstruction? Such questions are approached by modelling the evolving manuscript population through a birth-and-death process, with illustrative data for Greek and Latin literature.},

abstract = {The ambiguities of terminology are often the source of further difficulties for critics and text-historians. The term of « archetype » is used to indicate either « the nearest common ancestor of the tradition » or « the oldest witness of the tradition in which the text of an author has been put into the form that has been conveyed to us » (A. Dain) ; it seems that there is an advantage to choose the second meaning, which is the most common one, and to speak, in the second case, of « recension » or « edition ». But we learn from the text-history that the notion of archetype, in its first meaning, is too abstract, and unable to cover the reality of the text transmission. At last, the deep problem of contamination, which would prevent us to go back to the archetype, could be treated through other methods, particularly through the codicological study, but it is, before all, to be distinguished from the polygenesis facts, that occur very often among the cultivated scribes at the end of the Middle Age and during the Renaissance.}
