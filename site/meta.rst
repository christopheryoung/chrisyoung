**Disambiguation**

This is not the website of the composer named Christopher Young, the country
singer named Christopher Young, the football player named Christopher Young,
the baseball player named Christopher Young, or the British Christopher Young
who leaves astute comments on the same blogs I read using our name, thus saving
me the trouble of leaving those comments myself. These Christopher Youngs are
undoubtedly all excellent in their own way, but they're not me.

You're at the right place if you're looking for the Canadian Christopher Young
who grew up (mostly) in Ottawa, studied philosophy at the University of
Toronto, went to Cornell to do graduate work in the same field, eventually
dropped out, taught himself to code while waiting for a green card, became a
developer passionate about Python, Clojure and Haskell, and now lives very
happily in Brooklyn, NY with his wife, `Yoon Sun Choi
<http://yoonsunchoi.com>`_, and his son, Oliver.

A previous incarnation of this site was put together with Django. This version
uses the lovely `Hakyll<http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/>`_, a static site generator
written in Haskell. The code that generates this site is
`here<https://github.com/christopheryoung/chrisyoung>`_.
