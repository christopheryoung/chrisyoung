1.  In Thomson's paper &quot;A defense of Abortion,&quot; she argues
for the view that consensual sex does not constitute tacit consent to
carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.  Both Warren and Singer comment
on Thomson's argument - Warren to dispute it, and Singer to express
qualified support for it.  We also discussed this issue at length in
class.</P>

2.  One of the themes of our course has been the moral relevance of
the distinction between doing and allowing.  Discuss this issue in
connection with the issue of euthanasia in the texts we've read over
the course of the semester.

You'll want to look at Dworkin, Frey and Bok's book, at Peter
Singer's various discussions of the issue, and at the Philosopher's
Brief.  You will probably also find Kagan's discussion of the
distinction useful as well.

3.  Peter Singer discusses the difference between the total and prior
existence versions of utilitarianism in both his discussion of
euthanasia and his discussion of animal testing.  Singer is aware
that there is a tension in his views about these two versions of
utilitarianism: In his discussion of euthanasia he is attracted to
the total version; in his discussion of animal testing, to the prior
existence version.   And he describes how he's changed his own
opinion since the first edition of his book.

4.  We spent a lot of time in class discussing various slippery slope
arguments, especially as they come up in the debate about euthanasia
and physician-assisted suicide.  What is a slippery slope argument? 
How do each of the authors we've read handle slippery slope arguments
in the debate about euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide?  Do
you find any of the various slippery slope arguments discussed
plausible?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  Have the authors we've
read missed anything?

5.  Both the issue of abortion and the issue of animal testing put
pressure on the criteria we use to determine whether a being of a
given sort is morally entitled to certain kinds of protection. 
Recall that Warren sets out a series of criteria by which to
determine whether a being of a given sort is a person.   Against
philosophers like Noonan, Warren argues that what matters is not the
biological category of &quot;human,&quot; but rather the possession
of certain characteristics.  Singer takes an approach which is in
some respects similar, arguing that biological humanity is
irrelevant, and supplies his own list of characteristics, in virtue
of which a being a given sort has interests (and so is entitled to
have them taken into consideration). 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: -0.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: -0.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
But spelling out these criteria can lead to some rather sticky
questions.  One serious question for both Warren and Singer is
whether their views can adequately account for the fairly common
intuition that infanticide is morally wrong.  (On this question,
Warren seems ambivalent, and Singer (typically) goes ahead and
merrily bites the bullet.)  But if we insist on a less restrictive
set of characteristics, we seem to be led to the conclusion that
certain animals have far more right to have their interests taken
into account than our current practices (eating meat; medical
research) allow.

<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: -0.03cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">
How do Warren and Singer deal with these questions?  What are the
differences and similarities in their approaches?  How <I>should</I>
they deal with these questions?  Do they have the right criteria?  Or
can you do better?  Do they apply the criteria properly in the
various moral issues they discuss?  (Warren mostly focuses on
abortion, of course, though she does mention a few of the other
problems.  Singer's views on abortion, euthanasia and animal testing
are all relevant here.)</P>
