Description</B></U></FONT></FONT></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><BR>Introductory remarks 
</H1>
<P>This course is an introduction to biomedical ethics.  Biomedical
ethics is a branch of applied ethics that deals with ethical problems
which arise in medical contexts.  That includes, but is not limited
to, issues such as abortion, euthanasia, animal testing, cloning of
humans and animals, and so on.  
</P>
<P>These topics might be treated by different specialists in
different ways.  A public health specialist, for example, might look
at the issue of abortion in order to determine the best way to ensure
that unplanned pregnancies are minimized, or that access to abortion
is maintained in a community for people with different income levels.
 A philosophical approach to the same topics will inevitably overlap
with other approaches, but as will soon become clear, it is also
distinctive in important ways.  Perhaps most important, philosophical
treatments of a subject are often distinguished by a special concern
for broader questions about method, consistency, rigor and conceptual
clarity &ndash; more on what exactly that means in a moment.  That is
not to say that what a public health specialist does is shallow or
lacking in rigor &ndash; just that the focus of a philosopher's
attention will often be on questions of theory which the health
specialist has to set to the side in order to get on with her own
work.</P>
<P>Although a philosophical approach to any topic will involve
broader questions of theory, applied ethics nevertheless aims to
provide specific recommendations about morally difficult subjects. 
In this class, we will focus on three issues, paying special
attention to the connections between them as we go along.  These are:
abortion, euthanasia, and animal testing.  In each of these cases, we
will examine the conflicts of rights and interests which arise
between, respectively, the fetus and its mother, the patient and his
or her doctor, and the animal and the medical researcher who makes
use of it for human advantage.  
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">What is Applied Ethics?</H1>
<P>Applied ethics is often distinguished from normative ethics.  The
project of normative ethics is usually regarded as the attempt to
discover the moral theory which makes the best sense of our
considered moral intuitions.  For example, some normative ethicists
believe that our obligation is to do whatever promotes the most
pleasure (and the least pain) for the most people involved in any
decision.  For other normative ethicists, rights or duties are
morally fundamental.  
</P>
<P>On one way of thinking about applied ethics, applied ethics is
rather like applied mathematics.  In applied mathematics (or
engineering, and so on) we take our mathematical theories &ndash;
which we know independently of any particular case to be true &ndash;
and we apply them to concrete problems, such as how much weight a
particular bridge will bear given such and such forces acting on a
certain type of material.  If we think of applied ethics in the same
way, we will imagine that the task of applied ethics is to take our
normative theories &ndash; which we know independently of any
particular case to be true &ndash; and apply them to concrete moral
problems, such as abortion.  
</P>
<P>In my opinion, this way of thinking about applied ethics is
seriously mistaken.  For if we consider how we arrive at our
normative theories in the first place, it is at least partly as a
result of considering which theories handle specific cases most
plausibly.  The analogy with applied mathematics therefore threatens
to mislead us about the way in which moral reflection actually
proceeds: Typically, we begin with intuitions about about what is
morally right and test these intuitions against difficult cases. 
When we find a conflict, or an inconsistency, or the theory yields
results which seem terribly implausible, we often revise the theory
to bring it more in line with our considered views.  So when we
&quot;apply&quot; a normative theory to a specific case, such as
abortion or euthanasia, as often as not we are &quot;testing&quot;
the theory at the same time that we consider the particular case.  
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">How Philosophical Reflection Works</H1>
<P>That may make applied ethics seem like a hopeless task.  It is
not, though its difficulty should not be underestimated.  But don't
underestimate philosophers either!  We have lots of tricks up our
sleeves.  Philosophers make use of arguments, thought-experiments,
conceptual analysis and more &ndash; techniques we will be learning
quite a bit about.  What unifies all these techniques is an
overriding concern <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">to ground our
views on </SPAN><I>reasons</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
rather than mere prejudices or assumptions that we have taken up
without reflection.  (That doesn't necessarily mean that we will be
able to answer every question that might be raised about our views.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
 But it does indicate the general spirit of the project.)  Hopefully,
the nature of philosophical reflection will become clearer throughout
the course as we actually engage in it.  </SPAN>
</P>
<P>Philosophical reflection is especially concerned with consistency.
 We may find ourselves satisfied with our position on issue X because
we believe Z and position Y because we believe not-Z.  This obviously
raises a problem: Which is it going to be, Z or not-Z?  Philosophical
reflection often involves the search for interesting inconsistencies
in our views on different topics, which is one reason why it will be
useful for us to consider more than one issue in detail in this
class.  The attempt to restore consistency to our thinking may not
sound like a big deal, but it is as useful as it is difficult.  The
search for consistency can be a stimulus for further reflection on a
subject, can yield new insights, can drive us towards conclusions we
might not otherwise have accepted, and so on.  
</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">The Goals of this Class</H1>
<P>This class is designed with several goals in mind.  The most
obvious goal is that you develop a deeper appreciation for the
specific issues we will discuss: abortion, euthanasia and the ethics
of animal testing.  But I also have larger ambitions here.  Each of
these issues should serve as a basic model for how to think about <I>any</I>
ethical issue in a philosophically rigorous way.  If by the end of
the class you don't have a better appreciation of both the particular
issues and a better sense of philosophical problem-solving in
general, then at least one of us will have failed to do his or her
job.</P>

<P>I am not out to destroy anyone's GPA, but students should be
warned that this is not a &quot;bird course&quot;.  If we want to
make any progress, we're going to have to work hard.  As you plan
your work each week, please schedule yourself enough time to read the
course material <I>more than once</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.
 Philosophical writing is notoriously dense, and no one can absorb a
text simply by reading it once.  </SPAN>
</P>
<P>Course work will consists of the following: 
</P>
<P>1.  Attendance and participation (10%).  Lateness and disruptive
behavior both count against this grade.</P>
<P>2.  The best 5 Quizzes (5% each = 25%) out of 7.  There will be no
opportunity to make up a quiz, though if you have a doctor's note I
will take that into consideration in the assignment of your final
grade.  Quizzes are unscheduled and will be given at the beginning of
the class.  Latecomers may <B>not</B> write the quiz. 
</P>
<P>3.  Mid-term Exam (20%)</P>
<P>4.  A 2 page Essay Assignment (20%).  You will find the Assignment
on the course web site.  The late penalty for this assignment is one
third of a letter grade per day. 
</P>
<P>5.  Final Exam (25%)</P>
