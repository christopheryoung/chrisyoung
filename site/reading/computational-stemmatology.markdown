# Introduction

What follows is a to-do list in the form of a (thin, unsatisfying)
bibliographical essay. Watch this space: the essay will, circumstances
permitting, grow over time as I collect references and record brief remarks on
a few of them. I have a lot to add; it will take time to dump my private list
of resources into something worthwhile; still longer to find more resources;
and even longer still to say anything sensible about them.
Eventually---remember, circumstances permitting---this page may be of use to
someone other than me.

If you see an especially glaring error or omission, please feel free to let me

# Textual Criticism and Stemmatology

An accessible and engaging (non-technical) introduction to the whole world of
textual criticism (and more) can be found in:


* @reynolds1974scribes

Although scholars have struggled to establish texts on a solid foundation,
Lachmann, working in the second half of the 19th Century represented a
significant leap forward in rigour. Lachmann's contribution has been reviewed
in the following book, whose recent translation from the Italian we owe to
Glenn Most, who must never sleep:


* @timpanaro2005genesis

Introductions to the practice of textual criticism include:

* @maas1958textual

* @west1973textual

Both books are starting to show their age, the Maas in particular. But both are
worth reading, including the Maas, which is a little gem of a book summing up
the hard won insights of a true master. The West has a deeper discussion of the
phenomenon of contamination, if I recall, and is a great read too.

I have long been interested in reading this odd-sounding book, but haven't yet
gotten my hands on a copy:


* @timpanaro1976freudian


# Computational Stemmatology

The field of computational/mathematical stemmatology has flourished in recent
years. An early paper on the mathematics of manuscript descent was also
important in the development of modern phylogenetics:


* @Buneman1971

A triplet of papers by Flight in the early 1990s outline his own approach:

* @flight1990many

* @flight1992stemmatic

* @flight1994complete

This work seems to have been mainly ignored in subsequent work on the subject.
To do: check if this is the right attitude.

An important early spur to the development of the field was a challenge issued
in 1991, which is reviewed in:


* @robinson1992report

A sensible first step in the development of algorithms and techniques for
handling manuscript traditions is probably to generate artificial traditions to
various specifications so that we can observe how well the techniques fare
under different conditions (e.g., levels of contamination, mss loss, etc.).
This is not an original idea, as the following papers make clear:

* @spencer2004phylogenetics

* @baret2006testing

* @roos2009evaluating

See also the discussion [here](http://scribalculture.org/weblog/2010/12/27/artificial-textual-traditions/).

A trove of interesting papers can be found in:


* @van2004studies

These include, but are not limited to:

* @howe2004parallels

* @mink2004problems

* @schmid2004genealogy

* @wattel2004constructing

* @spencer2004effects

I list the remaining papers in this category in chronological order:

* @silva1969identification

* @o1993computer

* @gjessing1994stochastic

* @salemans2000building

* @howe2004parallels

* @mink2004problems

* @schmid2004genealogy

* @spencer2004effects

* @eagleton2006copying

* @bourdaillet2007practical

* @andrews2009prolegomena

* @schmidt2009data

* @schmidt2009merging

* @dekker2011computer

* @roos2011analysis

* @andrews2012analyzing

* @howe2012responding

* @andrews2013beyond

# Phylogenetics

A rather mathematically demanding introduction to Phylogenetics is:

* @semple2003phylogenetics

An introduction to phylogenetics which succeeds in being less intimidating
without apparent sacrifice of mathematical rigour is:

* @huson2010phylogenetic

As the book's title suggests, its emphasis is on phylogenetic *networks* as
opposed to simply *trees*, which should make it of special interest of
stemmatologists.

A random selection of papers I've come across follows, to be structured and commented on
later:

* @bandelt1992split

* @huson1999disk

* @strimmer1997likelihood

* @hagedorn2000determining

* @billera2001geometry

* @bastert2002landscapes

* @gascuel2005mathematics

* @vogtmann2007geodesics

* @paten2013unifying

* @huson2006application
