Three cheers for Max Sawicky's recent return to blogging. Try
[this](http://maxspeak.net/who-cares-about-inequality/) post about inequality
for a taste of the punchy, smart writing that goes up on his site, or
[this one on Obama](http://maxspeak.net/guess-ill-have-to-dream-the-rest/).
Don't settle for inferior blog posts. You need Max in your daily read.

With the money the U.S. blew on a canceled fighter plane it could have ["worked
wonders, including providing every homeless person in the U.S. a $600,000
home."](http://thinkprogress.org/world/2014/07/09/3458101/f35-boondoggle-fail/)
Oh well!

[points](http://mathbabe.org/2014/07/16/two-great-articles-about-standardized-tests/)
to two interesting pieces on standardized tests that are worth reading
together: Meredith Broussard's
[Why Poor Schools Can't Win At Standardized Testing](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/07/why-poor-schools-cant-win-at-standardized-testing/374287/)
at the Atlantic Monthly and and Rachel Aviv's
[Wrong Answer](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/07/21/wrong-answer) in
the New Yorker. These pieces make a nice follow-up to Dale Russakoff's
[Schooled](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/schooled) in a recent
New Yorker.

If you enjoy writing about Jazz, my friend and former roommate, the jazz
drummer Vinnie Sperrazza has started a
[blog](http://www.vinniesperrazza.org/blog). It's like sitting around the
kitchen table and listening to him hold forth all over again! Here, for
example, is a piece on
[the traditional grip](http://www.vinniesperrazza.org/blog/2014/4/22/on-traditional-grip).
Love it.

William Deresiewicz implores you
[not to send your kid to the Ivy League](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/118747/ivy-league-schools-are-overrated-send-your-kids-elsewhere):

> The changes must go deeper, though, than reforming the admissions process.
> That might address the problem of mediocrity, but it won’t address the
> greater one of inequality. The problem is the Ivy League itself. We have
> contracted the training of our leadership class to a set of private
> institutions. However much they claim to act for the common good, they will
> always place their interests first. The arrangement is great for the schools,
> but is Harvard’s desire for alumni donations a sufficient reason to
> perpetuate the class system?

Finally, Ben Wolfson literally
[hits it out of the park with this one](http://waste.typepad.com/waste/2014/07/on-a-popular-misconception-concerning-literally.html).
