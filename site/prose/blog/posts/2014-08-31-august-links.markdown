Hoo boy. What a month.

["Academic Urban Legends"](http://sss.sagepub.com/content/44/4/638.long) is a
paper about the way that academics sometimes play telephone in their citations.
The paper reminds me of the best exercise I was assigned as an undergraduate,
which was to take a single paper and track down every single citation to
primary and secondary evidence in it and evaluate its use. Some nice twists
here.

In a month filled with rudeness and hate, Paul Ford writes a thoughtful post
called
["How to be Polite"](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-9bf1e69e888c).
And Quinn Norton follows it up with
["How to be Polite . . . For Geeks"](https://medium.com/message/how-to-be-polite-for-geeks-86cb784983b1).

And finally, Slate takes a break from being annoying and does us the
[great service of putting up clips of Justice Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court sparring with lawyers about same sex marriage bans in Indiana and Wisconsin](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2014/08/27/listen_to_judge_richard_posner_destroy_arguments_against_gay_marriage.html).
I've never heard Posner's voice before: If I were a cartoonist drawing the
episode, I think I'd draw him as a sort of dopey, slow-talking turtle --- that
is, a dopey, slow-talking turtle who eviscerates the position of his
interlocutors! He's just relentless.
