The good news is that I'm inching ever closer to my goal of being able to climb 400 flights of stairs in one hour on the stairmaster at the gym.*  The other day, I hit 359, which is close, though I think adding those remaining 41 flights is going to be difficult.

The bad news, though, is that they really aren't joking when they say that exercise is addictive.  I try to set up my exercise schedule so that I never go more than two days without an exercise day containing an hour of cardio (on other days, I lift weights, do stomach crunches, or rest).  Going one day without my cardio workout is fine.  Going two days gets a bit dicey, though it's generally manageable if I'm doing other things.  Three days is bad.  Three days has me alternating between anxiety and rage, as I mentally work through a long list of suddenly discovered grievances with the world at large.

In November 2004 I was a confirmed couch potato.  A year and a half later I'm a serious endorphine junkie.  What the hell happened to me?

* I intend to prove that I have the ability to climb 400 flights in an hour by actually doing it.

Ever get any good Diss thinking done on that there stairmaster? Seriously: I'd like to know if anyone else leaves their desk and heads to the gym with the hope of having that insight that's been arms' lengths away all day, and then...HAS it!

It's happened to me only a couple of times. Sure wish it were a panacea.

Actually, yes.  When I was obsessed with blogging, I would write posts on the exercise machine and while walking the dog, etc. etc.  Now that I'm completely obsessed with my dissertation, I actually am writing portions of it in my head on the machine.  I did a bit this morning that way.  Not that I'm having blinding flashes of insight of the sort you're looking for.  But still, it's better than nothing.

Anne,

No.

But give a call some time (not tonight, though) and we can blend commiseration and inspiration together into one dazzling jolt!

I could, however, train you to have rock hard abs.

And, as a sign at my gym puts it, "bangin' buns."
