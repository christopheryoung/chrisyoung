<strong>Eugene Mirman. <em>The Will to Whatevs: A Guide to Modern Life</em></strong>

<em>The Will to Whatevs</em> is an extended spoof of a self-help book by NYC-based comic <a href="http://eugenemirman.com/">Eugene Mirman</a>.  Mirman offers advice on how to handle everything from childhood to your career to the afterlife.  Here's Mirman on whether you need to get a master's degree if you want to be a writer: <blockquote>Probably not.  Some people go to grad school for writing, but you don't have to.  Because, like, you have so much inside you that needs to come out.  Plus, nows-a-day there are edit people with fixy buttons to make everything read right.  On the other hand, the opposite point.</blockquote>Here is Mirman helping us to understand politics: <blockquote>Politics is simply how groups of people in various countries run their governments.  Some countries (that are assholes---China, Uzbekistan, Utah---LOL!) run their countries like a prison, while others run their countries like a pretend not-prison---i.e., citizens believe they are free and they don't want leave [sic], but also, they can't.  (Keep in mind that I am only trying to make an Almost Point.) The best examples of this are Russia and <em>Star Trek</em>'s various idealized-worlds-with-a-dark-secret, but I bet there are other places.</blockquote>Originally, I was going to say that if you like this, you'll probably like <em>The Will to Whatevs</em>.  But the question is really whether you would like <em>two hundred pages</em> of this.  In the first Preface (in this first printing of the book, there are two prefaces and three introductions), Mirman tells us to get ready for "a long hot shower of wisdom."  But this book is probably best taken in small doses.

I think I probably won't like (or, more likely, read) The Will to Whatevs.

I did like "On the other hand, the opposite point."  I wish I had come up with that.

Oh I think the first quote is very funny but the second one made me doubt whether it was really satirical or just the way he writes.
