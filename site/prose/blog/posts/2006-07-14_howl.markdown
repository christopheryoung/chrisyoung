A theme I see pursued occasionally on academic blogs like <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/">Crooked Timber</a> or <a href="http://weblogs.swarthmore.edu/burke/">Timothy Burke's site</a> is openness in research and teaching.  I think <a href="http://montejohnson.googlepages.com/protrepticus">this page</a>, set up by Monte Johnson to detail his work with D.S. Hutchinson on Aristotle's <i>Protrepticus</i>, is an model of open and generous scholarship.  It assembles quite a lot of useful material on the subject, and includes some transcripts from a seminar they co-taught this summer.  Since my dissertation touches on the subject of their research, this has been extremely helpful to me.

Anyway, I loved this bit from Papyrus Fragment POxy 3659, which they translate
as follows: <blockquote>And what about the philosophers themselves? If you
confined them in the one house and an equal number of madmen in another house
next door, you would get much, much greater howls from the philosophers than
from the madmen!</blockquote>(The fragment is of unknown provenance, and is
included in their collection of texts because it <i>might</i> be relevant to
Aristotle's <i>Protrepticus</i>.)
