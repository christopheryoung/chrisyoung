<strong>William Dalrymple. <em>In Xanadu: A Quest</em></strong>

<a href="http://www.explananda.com/?p=2350">After enjoying</a> William Dalrymple's <em>The Last Mughal</em>, I thought I would check out <em>In Xanadu</em>, Dalrymple's first book, written about his attempt during a summer break at school to retrace Marco Polo's travels from Jerusalem to Xanadu.  I read Marco Polo's own account of his travels when I was 20 years old, and found it more an inspiration to doze off than to travel 12,000 miles - it's mostly very boring, as even Dalrymple admits.  Dalrymple's book is much, much better.  It's interesting, well-paced, and often very funny.  The author was only 22 when he wrote the book, and occasionally it shows: he indulges a few times in some rather sweeping national stereotypes, for example.*  But if you enjoy travel writing, this book is well-worth your time.

* I don't object to this because I'm a humourless scold - though of course I am - but just because I doubt that a 20-something year old kid breezing through Asia hung around long enough to get it right.
