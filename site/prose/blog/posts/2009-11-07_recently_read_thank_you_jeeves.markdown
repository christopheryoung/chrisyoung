<strong>P.G. Wodehouse. <em>Thank you, Jeeves</em>.</strong>

Hmmmm, well, this novel, the very first full length novel in the Wooster/Jeeves series, does have its moments.  Unfortunately, it also features the N-word and a plot that hinges crucially on Wooster's wearing blackface.  I don't know---makes me uncomfortable, though as 1930s racism goes this is the mildest possible stuff.  I still think the best place to start with Wodehouse is <em>Code of the Woosters</em>.
