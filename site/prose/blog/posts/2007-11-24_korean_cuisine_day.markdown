We had some friends over today for our own little Korean cuisine festival.  Pictures below the fold.

First, Oi Kimchi (Kimchi made with cucumbers).  It begins, naturally enough, with cucumbers.

And ends up looking like this:

There were lots of other side dishes.  But the mandoo was the real hit of the meal.  First, you mix ground pork with garlic, onions, scallions, tofu, and bean sprouts.

Then you get a bunch of mandoo wrappers and some egg solution.

You dab your finger in the egg solution, put a bit of filling in, and seal up the mandoo.

Sitting around the table and talking is a lot of the fun.

Now you've got yourself some pre-cooked mandoo.

Then you toss 'em in boiling water for a bit.  They're yummy already!

Now they're ready for frying.

And now for the Soon tobu gigae.  This is a soup made from pork, onions, scallions, bean paste, hot pepper paste, hot pepper flakes, silken tofu, zucchini, and shittake mushrooms.  Here are some of the ingredients:

Then add them to the pot like so:

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3000.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3002.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3003.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3005.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3007.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

<img src="/media/explananda/IMG_3014.jpg" alt="" width="500px" />

Then enjoy!

It is exceedingly unfair of you to post such mouthwatering images without some kind of warning. In fact I believe you're in violation of the Oral Hydration Minimization Act Of 1995. Thanks a lot, Chris.

Those are amazing photos. What a delicious meal.

Aye goo chum, Kegri-ah!  Chikero!  Mogo gotchou!!!

Our side has two authentic Korean ladies wearing aprons with frogs and bunnies and listening to K-Pop while doing absolutely perfect imitations of their mothers.  You cannot withstand our awesome Koreanness, and will therefore be crushed.
