Walter Cronkite just died. My oldest political memories are of lying on
living room floor in front of the television and watching Walter Cronkite's
nightly newscast. In particular, I remember how he used to count off the days
of the Iranian hostage crisis. I also remember his last broadcast, and how he
almost looked a bit tipsy during it, though it could have simply been emotion.
I used to feel sorry for Dan Rather when he filled in for Cronkite, since
Rather seemed sort of nervous and high-strung compared to Cronkite. Anyway,
that's what I remember of Walter Cronkite.
