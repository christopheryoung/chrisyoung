January was a busy time at work and home. As far as philosophical reading goes,
I mostly read papers on substitutional quantification (along with relevant
background). I'd like to write up a little overview of that subject and publish
it here. The main risk is that (true to usual form) I'll research it endlessly
and never actually write anything, so my goal will be to put up something here
without getting hung up on quality.

I had a number of books on the go this month, but only finished two:

**Jon Raymond, *God and Sex***

As I read this book, I spent a lot of time trying to untangle my own personal
discomfort with it from my assessment of it as a work of art. It's a little
difficult to go into why without spoilers, so I'll stay vague. Part of the
issue---and yes, this is very silly---is that in general first person
narratives featuring extended dishonesty make me really uncomfortable. But this
is of course an eminently reasonable subject for a work of art. The narrator
also indulges in a wild amount of very unconvincing rationalization. The
narrator ends his tale, it seemed to me, with a very long way to go in
understanding what he'd lived through and done. Again, this is fine! But at
times I wasn't sure how much wiser the story was than the narrator. In the end,
though, I decided that the author had done that main thing that I ask of a
piece of fiction, which is to raise a series of questions that elude any simple
resolution. The reworking of themes from a novel of Graham Greene is well done.
As much as I disliked reading it, I have to admit that this novel wasn't bad.
Recommended especially for people who aren't me.

**Marshall Glickman, *Beyond the Breath: Extraordinary Mindfulness Through
Whole-Body Vipassana Meditation***

At the core of this book is the claim that whole-body vipassana meditation as
taught by S.N. Goenka is highly worthwhile. After he tried it, the author found
that it "fostered better moment-to-moment awareness" than meditation in the Zen
tradition that he had been doing and also compared with more narrowly
breath-focussed Vipassana.

That's the core of the book---exactly what you'd expect from the title---but
the core of the book is rather small. The chapter on technique is about 25
pages and could have been a pamphlet. Glickman does what he can to describe it,
but admits that this is difficult to transmit in writing, so he begins and ends
the book with (reasonable enough) exhortations to try 10-day retreats to really
learn the technique. There is a little bit more about whole-body vipassana
specifically, including his argument that it likely goes back to the Buddha,
and some useful comparison with other meditation traditions within Buddhism.

This material was welcome and interesting. But surrounding this small core is a
lot of general material about Buddhism that isn't really connected to
whole-body vipassana in particular. To my surprise, a central aim of the book
turned out to be showing "that science can be a valuable tool for understanding
Buddhism better." For example he tries to show that "karma can be understood as
our unconscious", drawing on "recent neurochemical findings". In line with this
ambition, Glickman tries to provide naturalistic explanations and
justifications for a few traditional Buddhist notions.

Although the author seems pretty likable---he writes with warmth, humility, and
an admirable lack of dogmatism---I did not care for much of this part of the
book. I'm much more familiar with attempts to naturalize ethics in the Western
tradition. It's a broadly promising research program, but there are a lot of
ways to develop it and a lot of ways to go wrong. Glickman's discussion seemed
to me largely unaware of the pitfalls and difficulties that meet serious
attempts to do this, so I found most of what he said frustrating or inadequate.

Actually, there were two major problems here. One is that the relationship
between science and other claims is handled badly. The other is that Glickman's
understanding of the relevant science is weak, apart from any attempt to relate
it to Buddhism. For example, he seems to go in for a pretty unsophisticated
version of extrapolative evolutionary psychology, apparently influenced by
Robert Wright's terrible book *The Moral Animal*. Agreed, humans are a product
of evolution, but there are a number of ways to go wrong when making specific
claims and predictions from that fact. It's just very hard to write and think
about this well, and because he seems unaware of the methodological issues in
this area, the text is bound to frustrate anyone who is aware of them.

Here's an example of sloppiness about what science tells us: Glickman repeats
the claim 'from Psych 101, if the word "Coke" is flashed on a movie screen for
a microsecond, much of the audience will head to the concession counter, even
though they had no idea they'd seen the word.' The truth is that the original
study (by Vicary) claiming to show this was already discredited in the 1960s
and empirical psychologists have only ever found very modest effect sizes. I
admit that this is just a footnote and not really a load bearing claim, but
come on, man.

Anyway, by the time I got to the author's speculation that "[r]ecent
breakthroughs in neurobiology suggest how precise karmic accounting can be
possible" I was not in a receptive mood. The author also tries to explain
Buddhist notions about the illusion of selfhood, but I had to add it to the
growing list of Buddhist discussions of this subject that I can't make any
sense of. More on this in another post, perhaps.

As for the practical advice about meditation in the book, much of it struck me
as interesting and well-presented. I'm currently also reading *The Mind
Illuminated*, another meditation manual, and was struck by differences between
Glickman's advice and the advice in that book. Glickman, for example, advises
against counting your breaths. He also advises against any kind of labeling as
you meditate. *The Mind Illuminated* offers both of those techniques to
beginners to help them on their way; they can outgrow them as they advance. I
suppose Glickman's worry is that you get better at what you practice, so you
should be careful to practice the right things from the start, whereas *The
Mind Illuminated* wants to make sure that people can get their practice off the
ground in the first place and is more confident that once they make progress
their practice can evolve. As a beginner, I'm not sure what the best approach
is---just mentioning something that caught my eye.
