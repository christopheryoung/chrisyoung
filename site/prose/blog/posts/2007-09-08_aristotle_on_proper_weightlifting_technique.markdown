Commenting on an obscure point about <em>connate pneuma</em> in his 1912 translation of Aristotle's <em>De Motu Animalium</em>, A.S.L. Farquharson writes that a comment of Aristotle's is, "a reference perhaps to holding the breath when a weight is lifted. A[ristotle], like gymnastic teachers to-day, supposed it gave power."

Interesting that Aristotle's assumption about breath still held in Farquharson's day.  My understanding is that this is not a good thing to do, and the laziest of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=holding+breath+weight+lifting&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">googlings</a> suggests that the current consensus is that the proper technique involves breathing out as you work the muscle through its range of motion and in as you relax it.  So, also, I was recently told by a rather large man at my gym who noticed that I was holding my breath a bit without noticing it, and who shouted, "Gotta breathe, baby, gotta breathe!"

I am often the only woman in a weight room full of men -- like, 40 or so -- and no one so much as says, "nice pipes!" to me.

You know what I've noticed? Is that after I've done my cardio and I'm lifting weights, I start yawning like crazy.

Aristotle has a lot of theories about breathing, doesn't he? (I guess that's true for just about any topic one could name.) The one I recall has to do with holding the breath being required to achieve orgasm.
