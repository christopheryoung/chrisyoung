	of cheap eats, tags: food}

Yoon is <a href="http://yoonsunchoi.com/news/?p=172">right</a>: a mandoo party is a great way to end up with a freezer full of yummy mandoo (Korean dumplings).  If you buy in bulk, we estimate that you end up paying about 14 cents a dumpling, which is really welcome when you're on a tight budget.  And you can avoid monotony by varying how you consume them: you can put them in soups or you can fry them up.

My only concern is that if we lost our power for a long period right after filling the freezer, we'd be fucked.  That hasn't happened yet, thank goodness.

A previous adventure in mandoo-making, complete with photos, is <a href="http://www.explananda.com/?p=2163">here</a>.
