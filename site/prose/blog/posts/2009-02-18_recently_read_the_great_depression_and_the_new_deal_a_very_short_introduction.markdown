<strong>Eric Rauchway. <em>The Great Depression and the New Deal: A Very Short Introduction</em></strong>

Good stuff.  I started the book with a very hazy sense of the Great Depression and the New Deal and emerged less than 150 pages of lucid, compact prose later with a clearer idea of the circumstances, complications, setbacks and triumphs of the New Deal.

(The author blogs at <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/">The Edge of the American West</a>, which is also worth checking out.)

Cool! Thanks for the suggestion.

Then again, everyone knows that the Depression didn't work, that it actually increased unemployment, and that World War II was not a grand stimulus program, it was a grand SPENDING program.
