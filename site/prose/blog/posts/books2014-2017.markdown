-The large city is New York
-novel of social criticism.
-As told to some distant future audience
-The general instability and scrounging of lives in a city dominated by the
-wealthy. The college debt and medical bill debt
-Not sure he had a clear conception of the audience

-p. 25 "Most people at this time ate meat. The opinion regarding the treatment
of animals by humans, in order of what was considered most evil to most
unremarkable, went: the ivory trade, which was the slaughter of elephants in a
distant land for their tusks; animal medical experimentation; the skinning and
wearing of fur; industrial meat farming; meat eating; dairy farms; petting
zoos; zoos; the eating of eggs; the drinking of milk; the keeping of household
pets."

p. 20: "Some people could achieve sexual intimacy with only one particular
gender. Most people are this time believed there were two of those. And many
believed these two genders were very distinct---almost separate species---and
so they should have different roles in life. Many, though, found this
ridiculous."

p. 34 gold or silver "which were chemical elements that were found in the
ground."

p. 98 no explanation of "hipster jeans"

p. 145: "Chad was becoming Joni Mitchell-friends with Edward. That meant he'd
IM with Edward and they'd talk about Joni Mitchell."

p 186: sample
Kevin had grown an enormous brushy mustache. "I was saying, does this tear off?
And he got so upset! He was like, no, I just grew it." John said. "I was like,
it looks good, and he was like, okay."
"I'm going to take a vacation. I'm going to take like three days off next week.
Whatever," John said.
