From the pseudo-Aristotelian <i>Problems</i>, Book XXX (on melancholics):
<blockquote>Wine also makes men affectionate; this is proved by the fact that
under the influence of wine a man is induced to kiss one whom no one would
kiss, if he were sober, either because of their appearance or their
age.</blockquote>
