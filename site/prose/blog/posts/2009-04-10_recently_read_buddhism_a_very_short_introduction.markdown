<strong>Damien Keown. <em>Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction</em></strong>

Keown manages to pack quite a lot into this very short introduction.  It's been popular in the West to see in Buddhism a rational religious alternative that is compatible with a modern secular outlook.  While acknowledging that there's a lot in Buddhism and the Buddhist tradition that lends itself to this treatment, Keown emphasizes just how much of Buddhism this approach manages to sweep under the rug: reincarnation, a belief in spirits, miracles, charms, and so on.  Buddhism has a number of schools, and a rich, complicated set of traditions associated with it.  This book gives a nice sense of some of that variety.
