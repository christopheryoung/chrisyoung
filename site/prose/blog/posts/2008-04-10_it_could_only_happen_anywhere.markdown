I was walking along Broadway around 20th St the other day and midway through the intersection, while pedestrians were allowed to cross, a man sat down crosslegged on the street so his companion could snap a quick photo of him.  Some idiot walking by turned to me and said "Only in New York!"

I'm not sure if that's my dumbest "Only in New York!" moment, but it's pretty
competitive.

In Boston the other day, I saw several people drinking Starbucks coffee. Only in Boston!

Chris - I just noticed the "it's possible to synthesize excited bromide in an argon matrix" tagline. That makes my day.

Finally!  I knew if I was patient the day would come.  I had to bite my tongue when we last talked on the phone.  Ha!

Paul, first of all that's a crazy idea, and I don't know where you got it.  Secondly, I just want to point out that you're working through your daily quota of allowed comments awfully quickly.

Paul, you're the one who got a PhD. Hardly seems in keeping with the spirit of the thing.

...that is, if anyone's breaking solidarity here, I think I know where to point my finger.

Also did you see the Rawls trading card? I can't remember if we've posted this here and frankly am too lazy to check...

This is very similar to that phenomenon where Americans talk as though America is the only country where people have "freedom."  As though Canadians and Swedes and the Japanese are living under despotism.

Oh, OK. It's the degree. I see. I thought I was breaking solidarity by posting.

Paul, you know I'm just razzing you because someday we'll all be "crashing on your sofa for a few weeks, just til the unemployment check comes through" while you lecture at Princeton or the UN or something.

It's funny, my advisor also referred to me as an UN-PHILOSOPHER.
