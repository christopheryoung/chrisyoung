<strong>ed. Robert D. Crews and Amin Tarzi. <em>The Taliban and the Crisis of Afghanistan</em></strong>

A collection of academic papers about the Taliban movement, past and present.  These are by scholars and written, I think, for scholars.  But the wealth of detail and insight here makes it worth the trouble for a non-specialist if she wants to move past a lot of superficial reporting about the region.  Topics include the causes of the rise of the Taliban; the intersection of the Taliban's religious fanaticism and Pashtun politics; the Taliban's anti-modern approach to the private sphere; and the present day neo-Taliban.  This last issue is of particular relevance to the situation in the country today.  The media often speaks about <em>the</em> Taliban, but the movement splintered after its defeat, with multiple spokesmen issuing conflicting demands and threats with little apparent coordination between them.
