<strong>Michael Pollan.  <em>The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</em></strong>

<em>The Omnivore's Dilemma</em> is an ethically and scientifically informed meditation on food, the modern food chain, and the ways in which the latter has distorted our relationship with the former.  Pollan provides a fascinating overview of the highly dysfunctional system of agricultural subsidies that spur the overproduction of corn and a few other staples, and traces the effects of the corn glut through the rest of the food economy.  He then explores alternatives to the modern agricultural system, beginning with mainstream organic farming, and moving on to much more radical departures from the mainstream.  I thought that the passages on the killing and eating of animals were especially thoughtful.

<strong>E.R. Chamberlin. <em>The Bad Popes</em></strong>

I'm not in a position to judge the reliability of the book, but I can say that it has a few entertaining moments, if Popes behaving badly is your thing.  In style and tone, this book reminded me a bit, for better or worse, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Julius_Norwich">John Julius Norwich</a>'s books.

<strong>Douglas A. Blackmon.  <em>Slavery By Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II</em></strong>

If the North won the American Civil War, the South surely won the reconstruction.  In the years following the Civil War, African Americans did not find themselves suddenly free to enjoy the fruits of the victory over their slave holders.  Rather, whites developed a system that permitted them to hold blacks down with the threat of terrible violence, and which allowed them to make use of their forced labour under conditions that were, very often, worse than those endured by many slaves under the old regime of slavery.

Here's how the system worked, as explained in considerable detail by Douglas A. Blackmon in his <em>Slavery By Another Name</em>: blacks would be arrested on bogus or trumped up charges.  These often included "vagrancy," an all-purpose charge to which any unemployed black man (in an era of massive unemployment) was vulnerable.  Sometimes the charge was even forgotten by the time the victim had been brought to court.  It hardly mattered.  A sheriff or local judge could always be found to find the victim guilty, regardless of the merits of the case --- especially because he could expect to profit himself from the proceedings.  The victim was then assessed a fine, along with fees associated with the costs of the proceedings.  Unable to pay, the victim would be coerced into signing an agreement to work off the sum in the service of a white who would pay in his stead.  Entirely deprived of rights, blacks could then be locked up, beaten, tortured, fed next to nothing, traded, sold, and worked under conditions that accounted for the extremely high mortality rates among prisoners.

Every aspect of this twisted system is sickening.  Arrest rates rose and fell according to the labour required in an area.  The constant threat of arrest served as a reliable way of keeping blacks who weren't prisoners in line.  Any African American not directly under the protection of a white was vulnerable to arrest on trumped up charges.  This power also helped perpetuate the widespread rape of African American women by white men.  This is the bleak picture of American American life in this period that emerges from Blackmon's account.  If there is one figure that captures all this in a book filled with anecdotes, figures and arguments, it is surely this: that between the years 1877 and 1966 in the state of Georgia, only <em>one</em> white man was found guilty of murdering a black man.

The system also helped wealthier whites to crush attempts to unionize their industries.  It's hardly surprising that these attempts failed when management could always resort of cut-rate prisoner labour in the face of a threat to strike.

Blackmon makes a very strong case that this era of American history is best described as the Era of Neoslavery.  It wasn't until the second World War had begun that the Federal Government moved to begin enforcing laws in the South that it had long chosen to ignore.

This is a superb book, as angry as it is methodical.  It's essential reading for anyone who wants to understand U.S. history.  But because Blackmon does such a good job reflecting on the consequences of that history, it's also essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the present.


<strong>Susan Blackmore. <em>Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction</em></strong>

The title says it all.  It was indeed very short, and the length of the text made it impossible for the author to do anything more than introduce a few topics in the study of consciousness.  But as introductions go, this one struck me as pretty good: clear, readable, and interesting.  Lots of good stuff on everything from the latest in philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and more.
