<strong>Rashid Khalidi. <em>Sowing Crisis: The Cold War and American Dominance in the Middle East</em></strong>

I read and <a href="http://www.explananda.com/?p=2743">enjoyed</a> Khalidi's <em>The Iron Cage</em> back in January, and so got this, Khalidi's latest book, out of the library shortly afterwards (I'm only getting around to writing about it now).  <em>Sowing Crisis</em> is a more sharply polemical book than <em>The Iron Cage</em> and I liked it a bit less, partly because I have a limited appetite for polemic and partly because Khalidi isn't really great at it.  (He's not awful; just not great.)  Nevertheless, there is a lot in this wide-ranging review of American foreign policy to learn from and by stimulated by.  Khalidi's main objective seems to be to try to get Americans to understand how non-Americans see American foreign policy.  This is a worthwhile project, and <em>Sowing Crisis</em> is a worthwhile book.
