<strong>John Daishin Buksbazen. <em>Zen Meditation in Plain English</em></strong>

A beginner's book about zazen in Zen Buddhism, the practice of "just sitting."  The book focuses on breathing meditation, and gives practical tips (with sketches to help) about posture, breathing, and dealing with various obstacles encountered in meditation.  I found it among the most helpful books I've read on this subject.  The book has very little to say about Buddhism as a philosophy, emphasizing that the practices of meditation described in the book are compatible with a number of different religious traditions, as well as with atheism.
