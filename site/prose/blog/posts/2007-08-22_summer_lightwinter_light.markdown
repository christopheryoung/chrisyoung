It's a gray day, and the light coming in my window now has a sort of wintry quality to it.  This had the effect of momentarily putting me in a winter frame of mind, and the coolness of the room probably helped with that too.  I don't know what it's like for you, but for me, winter and summer go along with entirely different frames of mind, so it's very odd to be reminded of the one when I'm in the other.  

I was originally about to describe these as different moods. But they're more than moods, so "frames of mind" is probably better.  I think I'm sometimes inclined to call them moods because the respective frames of mind are emotionally coloured.  It's very hard to describe but: Winter: cozy if I'm inside, a little sad, thoughtful, reserved, a sort of focussed energy.  Summer: Happier, less complicated, a less focussed energy, and a part of me that stays clenched throughout the entire winter relaxes.  And something about the quality of each gets projected onto the world, so it's not just a way of feeling; it's a matter of feeling a certain way <em>about</em> everything I come across.

I remember vividly the first time I noticed this.  I was in high school, and I remember getting out of the shower on a summer day.  It was overcast, like today, and something about the way that the light was striking the blinds made me suddenly think of winter.  Seeing the light strike the blinds in that way suddenly made me aware of how very different the frames of mind are.  It's not that I had missed it previously because the difference is subtle.  Rather, it's because the difference is so total that it's hard to remember the one way of feeling about the world from within the other.

Is here the place to point out that there has never been a more wintry album than Joni Mitchell's "Blue"? I think it is.

It may also be one of the three or four greatest albums ever. But that's just me.

I don't know if we have that one.  I'll look out for it.

It's very weird to see "howls of outrage" at the bottom of this post.
