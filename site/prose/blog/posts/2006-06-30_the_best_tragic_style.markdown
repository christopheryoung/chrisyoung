From Aristotle's <i>Rhetoric</i>, III.3: <blockquote>As for what Gorgias said
to the swallow which, flying over his head, let fall her droppings upon him, it
was in the best tragic style. He exclaimed, "For <i>shame</i>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philomela">Philomela</a>!" For there would
have been nothing in this act disagraceful for a bird, whereas it would have
been for a young lady. The reproach therefore was appropriate, addressing her
as she was, not as she is.</blockquote>
