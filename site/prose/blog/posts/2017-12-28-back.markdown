It's been more than three years since I posted here. The hiatus began when I
was busy, and continued because I was too busy and too tired to simultaneously
figure out how I had borked the hsenv I was using to run Hakyll to build this
site and upgrade from Hakyll version 3 to 4. After much dithering and
procrastinating upgrading Hakyll and switching to use stack instead of hsenv
turned out to be <a
href="https://github.com/christopheryoung/chrisyoung/commit/f7faeee58d4c4b30747db3f42c81639421acbeda">trivial</a>.

Excited by how easy this was, I turned to the database dump I had from my old,
now defunct, group blog, explananda. I wasn't able to get that database
cooperating with a local installation of WordPress, so I wrote a little Python
script to query the database and then format the posts in a Hakyll-friendly
way. I then sat down and read some of the posts. Painful! My writing from that
period is mostly excruciating to read, so I imported just a few of the
thousands of posts I wrote for the old site, and marked them as such. Going
back over old posts, it was the comments that I really enjoyed and that, sparse
as they usually were, gave the blog its life and the little value it had. Oh
well.

And I'm back! Now that I once again have a place to write, I'll try to make an
effort to do it once in a while.
