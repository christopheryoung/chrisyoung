Nedda C. Allbray. <em>Flatbush: The Heart of Brooklyn</em>

Fun stuff, if you live in my neighbourhood.  If not, perhaps not your cup of tea.  Anyway, this caught my eye: <blockquote>The importance of easy access to rapid transit was not lost on T.B. Ackerson, the builder of Beverly Square East and West, who, during the construction process, used his political clout to get both the Beverly Road and Cortelyou stations built.  Those two local stops are one block apart, the closest subway stops in the system.</blockquote>And it's true!  They're very close together---about the length of a damn subway!---as the not-very-good picture below suggests.  It's taken at Cortelyou station, looking down the tracks to Beverly station.  I just <em>knew</em> that money and political clout had to explain the closeness of the stations.

Good pic.  It never occurred to me to stand at the far end of the platform and look up toward Beverly.

Blink, and you miss the Cortelyou Rd. station.  Good thing that station and Newkirk are only three blocks apart.

I think I'd rather walk the extra 50 metres than know the train was going to stop straight away every time I got on it.
