"Aristotle taught that character is defined by habitual action. There is no
such thing as a good man who happens to do unjust things, Aristotle believed,
because what a man does defines him. Indeed, Aristotle's prescription for
virtue was simply to keep doing the sort of thing a virtuous man does. Modern
specialists in political communication are an Aristotelian species." (p. 34)

We better hope that no one plagiarizes this passage in a term paper.

p. 44 - "This book seeks to explain Harpers's success as something more than an
accident and his appeal as something more than a trick. My argument is that
Harper wins elections because millions of people want somebody like him to be
prime minister. They have a broad sense of who he is and what he wants to do,
and they prefer it to the alternatives."
