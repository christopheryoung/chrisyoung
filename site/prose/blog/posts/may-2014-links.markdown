Ta-Nehisi Coates pulls off the article of the month (at least) with his
[The Case for Reparations](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/).

Tom Stafford explains
[the best way to win an argument](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140521-the-best-way-to-win-an-argument)
and the New Yorker offers another take on
[why it's an uphill battle](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/mariakonnikova/2014/05/why-do-people-persist-in-believing-things-that-just-arent-true.html).

I have been raising my eyebrows over Nicholas Wade's science journalism at the
New York Times for a long time, so it's nice to see him come out with a book that
[basically confirms my hunch about his biases](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=12496).

Beth Schwartzapfel has a great piece
[on prison labour](http://prospect.org/article/great-american-chain-gang) in The
American Prospect.

Finally, Paul Ford is [hilarious](https://medium.com/message/it-is-impossible-to-believe-how-mindblowing-these-amazing-new-jobs-are-abf5f3fb39e9).
