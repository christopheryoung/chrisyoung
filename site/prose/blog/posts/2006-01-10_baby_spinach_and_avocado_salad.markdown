This is a not-very-good picture of my latest favourite salad:

It's very easy to make: Take some baby spinach, wash it, and pat it very dry.  Cut up an avocado or two (I use one per serving, but that's because I'm sort of a pig), and throw it into the mix.  If you're feeling really decadent, cut up some fresh - if it's not fresh, don't even bother - mozzarella cheese.

This goes very well with the simplest of dressings: In a bowl or whatever, vigorously mix some olive oil, red wine vinegar, a pinch of salt, a bit of pepper and some Dijon mustard.  The mustard is especially important, since it acts as an emulsifying agent for the otherwise unmixable olive oil and vinegar combination.  (Thanks, Alton Brown!)  Add just as much dressing to the salad as you need to in order to lightly coat it.

And you're done!  Total preparation time, even if you're a real dawdler, is about five minutes.

Mmmm...my favorite salad in the whole world is what you have above, with the addition of a sliced hard-boiled egg and some portabella mushrooms that have been marinated in balsamic vinegar.  Yummers....

That sounds yummy too.  I like to marinate portabella mushrooms for a few hours in olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, lemon juice, fresh basil, pepper and salt.  Then fry 'em up, and eat 'em!

In the absence of decent mozzarella, a small amount of roquefort or similar makes a good alternative. Not the same, but dead nice.

Another way to get the otherwise immiscible oil and vinegar to play nice is VIGOROUS SHAKING.
