I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aristotle-Nicomachean-Translated-Introduction-Commentary/dp/0198250665/sr=8-1/qid=1163553878/ref=sr_1_1/103-4388510-8011037?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this</a> from Amazon.com and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Cheap-Free-Cancun-Yucatan/dp/0975596306/sr=8-1/qid=1163553816/ref=sr_1_1/103-4388510-8011037?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">this</a> came instead.  The name and address on the outside of the package is mine, but the book comes wrapped in an inner package with a strange name and a Wisconsin address on it.  I was going to pose with it, as I have in the past, <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/001508.html">when I wanted to add pathos to my customer complaints</a>, but I'm feeling too lazy for that now.

Amazon does have it's moments, though.  This summer they recommended that I try reading Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, which loyal readers will recognize as the subject of my dissertation.  Good idea, guys.  I may try that some time.

I got the same thing: Amazon suggests that I take a look at Rawls's <i>Political Liberalism</i>, despite the fact that I think I'm one of two or three people who know that while Rawls tells us (<i>Collected Papers</i>, p.573n1) that the pagination is identical across the first two editions, in fact the first page of the original Introduction in the first edition is xiii, while in the second it's xv.

Now, if only <i>that</i> would come up in a job interview!

Paul, everyone knows that.  I think something similar happens in - what's it called? - <i>The Theory of Justice</i>.

Right.  By kicking you in the Rawls.

That's a sad pun compared to my CY's-dissertation-related pun <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/000925.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Maybe Amazon's algorithm analyzed your purchase history and determined, "What this guy <em>really</em> needs is a <em>holiday</em>."

Paul, I don't think I had seend your previous fine work. Full marks.

And Chris, very nice. Reminiscent of the recurring State sketch in which there's a character, Louie, who comes into a scene, identifies a substance ("Hey, that's some nice guacamole!" "Hey, is that holy water?"  "Hey, the Pacific Ocean!"), and says "I'm gonna dip my balllllls in it!"

Which of course, I silently thought to myself all through my grad school political philosophy courses... I'm gonna dip my Rawwwwls in it! (Sometimes, I'm gonna dip John Rawls in it. Or even, I'm gonna dip Lou Rawls in it.)

Sigh. And that why now I'm jobless and dissertationless, in the frigid north.

Anne,
Three cheers for you.  That's a winning thought, and I wish I had had it, or one of similar quality, while I was taking political philosophy classes.

You were probably busy thinking about dull things like justice, right action, and the concept of self-interest.
