<strong>W.H. Auden, with drawings by Filippo Sanjust. <em>Academic Graffiti</em></strong>

This book only takes 15 or 20 minutes to skim through, even at a leisurely pace, but if you're a pointy-head, it's probably still worth a trip to the library for it.  A clerihew is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerihew">so I'm told</a>, "a whimsical four-line biographical poem . . . The lines are comically irregular in length, and the rhymes, often contrived, are structured AABB."  This book contains sixty-one clerihews of Auden's.  E.g., 
<blockquote>
Disiderius Erasmus
Always avoided chiasmus,
But grew addicted as time wore on
To oxymoron.</blockquote>
Auden takes aim at some familiar names---Aquinas, Beethoven, Blake, Robert Browning---and some unfamiliar ones.  I admit that some of the poems went right over my head, even when I recognized the name:
<blockquote>
Robert Browning
Immediately stopped frowning
And started to blush,
When fawned on by Flush.</blockquote>
Did you know that Elizabeth Barrett had a dog named "Flush"?  I didn't, and this dog was even the subject of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush:_A_Biography">fictional autobiography</a> by Virginia Woolf (!).  

Anyway, good for a laugh or two.
