<strong>John Chadwick. <em>The Mycenaean World</em></strong>

The Mycenaean Greeks flourished on parts of mainland Greece and on Crete and a few surrounding islands from about the sixteenth to the thirteen centuries B.C.  We don't know why their civilization collapsed, one city after another, at the end of this period, but when it did Greece entered a period of decentralized, impoverished chaos.  The <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em> were put together around 800 B.C., as Greece began to emerge from this dark age.  Both hearken back over the centuries (often anachronistically, as I'll point out below) to the dimly remembered golden age of the Mycenaean world.

The Mycenaeans wrote, but mainly on perishable substances, like parchment.  Parchment falls apart eventually; as far as I know, not a scrap of parchment with the Mycenaean script on it survives.

Fortunately, the Mycenaeans also wrote on clay tablets, a cheap and easy way of keeping temporary records.  These were discovered at several sites, the most important of which were at Knossos, on Crete, and at Pylos, on the Western prong of the Peloponnese.  They would certainly have crumbled away long ago, but fortunately (for us) both sites were ravaged by fire for some reason and never rebuilt.  The clay tablets baked in the fires, turning the temporary writing surfaces into items sturdy enough to survive to the present.

For many years, the Mycenaeans were known to us only through the efforts of archaeologists, who had only the mute relics of this era to assemble theories about it.  We had the tablets, but the Mycenaeans did not use the Greek alphabet that we've all come to know and love.  Indeed, for some time a firm majority of scholars insisted that whatever the tablets meant exactly, the language employed on them was not Greek.  We call the script "Linear B," and for years it was a tantalizing mystery.

The problem was not cracked by mainstream scholars, most of whom were hooked on the "not Greek" theory.  Instead, a brilliant and eccentric British architect named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ventris">Michael Ventris</a> made the most important breakthrough in 1952, shortly before his untimely death at the age of 34 in a car crash.  He was soon joined by the Classicist John Chadwick, who contributed a number of breakthroughs of his own, and then wrote a series of foundational works on the subject.  Linear B <em>was</em> Greek after all, though a very archaic form of it.

If you were hoping for great literature, the surviving texts in Linear B are a grave disappointment.  But they are not without their uses: 
<blockquote>At first sight their contents are deplorably dull: long lists of names, records of livestock, grain and other produce, the account books of anonymous clerks.  Here and there a vivid description of an ornate table or a richly decorated chariot breaks the monotony.  But for the most part the tablets are drab and lifeless documents.  Their one virtue is their utter authenticity, for they contain the actual words and figures noted down by the men and women who created the same civilization that has yielded such splendid treasures to the archaeologist's spade.</blockquote>

With the decipherment of Linear B, we could finally supplement, modify, and correct many of the aspects of the picture given to us by archaeologists working on the period.  Although <em>The Mycenaean World</em> is alive to the archaeological evidence at every step, it's central mission is integrating this rich trove of written evidence into our view of the Mycenaeans.  

<em>The Mycenaean World</em> is a work of consummate scholarship about a fascinating, remote era.  I would guess, though, that a nonspecialist would require a fairly strong degree of antecedent interest in the subject to get through it.  The book is well-written, but it offers a level of detail that could easily wilt the curiosity of most readers.  How much do <em>you</em> want to know about the Mycenaean system of weights and measures?  If the answer is, "several pages, at least!" then by all means, this is your book.  Otherwise, you might want to stick to Homer for a glimpse of this distant world.  On the other hand, you should know that by doing so you'll be sacrificing authenticity for action.  Perhaps the most interesting chapter in <em>The Mycenaean World</em>, "Homer the pseudo-historian," points out how dimly the period was remembered by the time Greece finally started to climb out of the dark ages that separated the Mycenaeans era from the vibrant renaissance that began several centuries later.

Damn it, I've returned the book to the library and can't now check to see what basis Chadwick gave for this claim (it's his, I think, not mine).  As far as I can remember (not very far) it might simply have been that many of their neighbours were writing on perishable surfaces of some sort or another, so the technology was highly available, and the tablets were clearly only part of their written accounting system.  Chadwick tends to be pretty careful about such things, and I didn't get the sense that this was a flight of speculative fancy.

I've just returned myself from a week away, and you're thinking more important thoughts now, but if I remember aright, Chadwick did make that point, but also argued at least partly from the nature of the characters being too complex and curly to have evolved purely for inscribing in clay, which doesn't take naturally to such inscription (cf. the evolution of cuneiform from Sumerian ideograms).

Me, I thought that seemed like a good case for Linear A, but since Linear B was evidently adapted from the earlier script, it implicitly assumed that the Mycenaeans had adopted the practice of writing more complex documents at the same time, when they might only have been interested in record keeping.

But what do I know?

That actually rings a bell (the argument about the nature of the characters).  Damn, you've clearly got much better memory than I do.  I really am going to go back to buying books as soon as possible.  This is why I need to have them handy for reference.

My (uncertain) memory is that Chadwick's speculation is that the soft-surface writings were also supposed to be for record keeping.  

But what do <em>I</em> know?
