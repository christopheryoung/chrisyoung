So I finally broke down and joined Facebook a few days ago. 

Most of the people I know don't have blogs.  Of course I knew in some abstract way that they might well be hanging out somewhere else online, but because I hardly even bothered to peek over Yoon's shoulder when she was on FB, I didn't realize the sheer volume of activity going on elsewhere, in that semi-private zone away from the world of blogs.  It's sort of like walking down a quiet, industrial street, turning into a dark path between two houses, and suddenly finding yourself in a lush garden filled with people talking and laughing and drinking, like in some beer commercial.  Huh.

OK, so the blogosphere is <em>not</em> best described as a quiet, industrial street.  I just mean that most people aren't there, and a whole lot of people I know seem to be on FB.

Beyond that, and a general admiration at how they must be handling the technical challenges inherent in offering a service like this, I don't have much of an impression to report yet.

actually, i think FB has killed a few good blogs. the bloggers stopped blogging when they joined FB and found an alternate avenue for online expression.

the problem is that there are some things that FB doesn't do as well as blogs. you can make some point in a status update, but there's no permalink for anyone to refer back to it later. after a few weeks it's effectively gone. there have been a few times where someone wrote something really good on FB, weeks later i allude to it in my blog and want to attribute it to them, but realize i really can't. at least not easily. and to a lazy person like me that equals can't.

so welcome to FB! i'm just hoping it doesn't kill explananda

Oh wow, hadn't realized that FB doesn't archive stuff well.  No, it won't kill Explananda.  Explananda will never die!  It will only slow down occasionally when I get really busy, as I have been lately.

It's funny that people seem to feel more comfortable sharing stuff on fb than on a blog.  I find that I feel less restrained on the blog.  Hardly anyone reads it!  But I've got 60 friends on fb already.  Suppose only half of them ignore me.  Still, that's 30 people who are going to see my comment if they log in on fb soon after I've made it.  That could include my brother in law, my 5 year old niece, some religious friends, family, and so on.  I just don't worry as much about not offending or boring those people when I post to Explananda, since I know they either don't read the blog or think they should just stop reading if it really bothers/bores them.

it makes sense though, FB is more restrictive. the stuff you write can only be seen by a list of friends who you pre-approve. what you write here is accessable by anyone, even random googlers. of course you're going to feel more comfortable sharing stuff over there than here.

one good thing FB has done for the blogging world is it has helped end the "blog memes" fad. people don't list what's on their ipod, or random facts about themselves on blogs as much as they did a few years back. that stuff is all on FB, which is really where it belongs.

Ah, but I'm pointing out the difference between content being access<em>ible</em> and content being access<em>ed</em>.  True, it's more accessible here, but it's much more likely to be accessed by a broad range of people I have a personal connection with on fb.  Anyway, that's why I'm not having the standard reaction to fb, which is also perfectly reasonable for the reasons you give, of course.
