From Hume's <i>An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, Chapter VI (Of
Qualities Useful to Ourselves)</i>: <blockquote>What derision and contempt,
with both sexes, attend <i>impotence</i>; while the unhappy object is regarded
as one deprived of so capital a pleasure in life, and at the same time, as
disabled from communicating it to others. <i>Barrenness</i> in women, being
also a species of <i>inutility</i>, is a reproach, but not in the same degree:
Of which the reason is very obvious, according to the present
theory.</blockquote>That's awfully raunchy by the standards of the 18th Century
British moralists, isn't it? At least, I don't remember anything in, for
example, Butler's sermons on the importance being able to maintain an erection.

Oh, puh-leeze. You don't think that Butler ever chuckled about his claim to extensive knowledge of "self-love"?

Paul,
Bingo!  (I had a private bet with myself that you would make a Butler/self-love joke before the end of the day.)

Of course, making a joke about Butler on self-love is practically obligatory on a post like this.  I was just predicting that you would do the right thing, Paul.

Yeah, I guess a joke involving John Gay or Lord Shaftesbury would have been more impressive.

I too looked wistfully in the direction of a Shaftesbury joke, but no play on the first five letters of his name could really disguise the fact that I've never read him.

I've never read Hume, Gay, Butler or Shaftesbury, but I would like to point out that the last four letters of Shaftesbury's name have potential for this hypothetical joke, as do "Gay," "John," "Lord," and "Butler."

Tia,
Indeed.  I was especially mulling over the "bury" and thinking that might work - but how? how? - with "Shaft."  But in the end more jokes would have taken thought and effort, and Hume's words are just so awesome on their own.  I especially loved the "communicating it to others" bit for some reason.
