Sarah Kendzior has [a great piece](https://medium.com/p/fa4c36eb306b/) on
minimum wage workers at Medium. A notable strength of the piece is that she
lets the workers talk for themselves. She said on Twitter after it came out
that this is precisely what editors objected to when she tried to publish the
piece elsewhere, and that she took a pay cut to publish on Medium with the
voices intact. Good on her. May she win a thousand lotteries as Karmic
compensation.

A lengthy
[review](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/apr/24/innovation-government-was-crucial-after-all/)
at the NYRB takes on myths about the relationship between private and public
sectors and innovation.

Radio lap has a nice story about
[whale poop](http://www.radiolab.org/story/power-poop-whale-story/).

Slate Star Codex has a hilarious and instructive
[review of problems in contemporary scientific methodology](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/).

And finally, April is the month I discovered the not-actually-new-in-April
[Girl Walk All Day](http://girlwalkallday.com/watch-the-film) film. I'm a text
guy. I read text. I don't have much patience for moving pictures or audio. I
clicked on this link expecting to watch 20 seconds of video (mainly to see if
my son might enjoy it) before moving on to something else. And yet I stayed---and
stayed up late---for the whole dang thing. The dancing in the video is so funny
and uninhibited and joyous. Love it.
