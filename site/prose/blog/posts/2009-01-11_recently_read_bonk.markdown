<strong>Mary Roach. <em>Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex</em></strong>

As the title indicates, this book is about the science of sex, but unlike the <a href="http://www.explananda.com/?p=2727">recently reviewed</a> <em>Science of Orgasm</em>, the science is presented in a way that is much more accessible to a lay reader.   Not content to offer a clear and readable overview of modern sexology and its many intriguing questions, Roach was also clearly aiming to write a funny book.  In this she certainly succeeded, but, as they say, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=YMMV">ymmv</a>.  Roach can be funny---indeed, at times, absolutely hilarious.  But the book is so chock full of jokes and wisecracks, which are, I'm sorry to report, of vastly varying quality, that at times it was almost too much even for me (of all people).  At times.  But in the end the book is undeniably a lot of fun and certainly worth reading.  And if I'm going to report that I groaned over a few of the jokes, I should also admit that I found it very difficult to put down.
