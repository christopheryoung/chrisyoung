I was taking a walk this afternoon when I passed two people trying to park a car on the side of the street.  The car was in neutral, the engine off.  A woman was steering.  A man who looked at least 70, and very tired, was pushing ineffectually at the rear of the car and saying something like, "Turn the wheel to the right.  You need to turn the wheel to the right."

I walked over and said, "Excuse me, do you need a hand pushing?"

And he turned to me and, without any trace of sarcasm or hostility or anything that might have led me to think he was being anything but serious, said "Oh, no thanks.  We'll turn the engine on if we need to."

I don't get it; what book was involved here?

It's true that I've been book-happy lately, Ben.  But, taking the long view, less than 4% of the posts on this blog are about books.

Maybe it was an old performance artist, out of good ideas.

Chris, keep up the book reviews, they're excellent.

Ok - seriously, based on the transcript of the conversation, I'm guessing that he was merely referring to one of these that he had in his trunk:

Defacing a valuable public resource just to score a cheap point, Kegri?  At what cost victory?

You win this round.  But we'll meet again.  Oh yes, we'll meet again.
