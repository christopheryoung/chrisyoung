I recently needed to draw a publication quality stemma codicum. It looked as if
the LaTeX tikz package is sometimes used for this purpose, but examples---the
way I learn best---were hard to find. To help the next person who comes
along, I uploaded an example repository to github. See
[here](https://github.com/christopheryoung/stemma_with_tikz_example).

Feedback and improvements welcome.
