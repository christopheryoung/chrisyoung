<strong>Caitlin Macy. <em>Spoiled: Stories</em></strong>

<em>Spoiled</em> is a collection of short stories, all of them featuring women or girls, most of them wealthy Manhattanites, usually newly wealthy.  The stories are about the problems and preoccupations of this class: difficult maids and nannies, rivalries over status and wealth, struggles with envy and schadenfreude.  I only come into occasional glancing contact with the types depicted in these stories---just often enough to see that Macy has a pretty good eye for social observation.  But what a <em>cold</em> eye: there isn't a genuinely sympathetic character in the book; nor is there a single moment of intimacy or warmth between two human beings.  I expect a lot of people would find the privileged characters in this book too obnoxious to justify the trouble of reading an entire book about them, but I actually found my interest more or less sustained throughout.  The writing is uneven: weak in places, pretty good in others.

I don't think there isn't a genuinely sympathetic character in the class.
