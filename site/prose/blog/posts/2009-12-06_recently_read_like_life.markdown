<strong>Lorrie Moore. <em>Like Life</em></strong>

This collection brings together eight short stories by Moore that appeared in various publications during the 1980s.  They're a pleasure to read: crisply written, well-observed pieces, mostly in a minor key, though with some genuinely funny moments.  Moore saves her best lines for her characters, who often sound funny and insightful without ever arousing the suspicion that they're being used as a mouthpiece for the author.
