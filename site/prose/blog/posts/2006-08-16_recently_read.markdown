For fun, not work:

---Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i>.  Classic tale, with useful pointers in case you should ever find yourself stuck in the middle of a hostile kingdom after having backed an aspirant to the throne who has gone and died in battle.  Oh, those plucky Greeks!

---Plutarch's Lives of Demosthenes, Cicero, Alexander and Caesar.  The life of Alexander was fun to compare with Arrian's biography, also recently read.  

---Wodehouse. <i>Uncle Fred in Springtime</i>.  More wanton silliness.

---Anthony Grafton. <i>Forgers and Critics</i>.  Lived up to my <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/001628.html">expectations</a>.

-Jonathan Ames. <i>Wake Up, Sir!</i>  Already <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/001631.html">mentioned here</a>.  

ed. Lawrence Trittle. <i>The Greek World in the Fourth Century: From the fall of the Athenian Empire to the successors of Alexander</i>.  What a bloody and complicated mess the Fourth Century B.C. was in Greece.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around the basics.  

Arnaldo Momigliano. <i>The Classical Foundations of Modern Historiography</i>.  Oh <i>Arnaldo</i>!  I think I'm in love.
