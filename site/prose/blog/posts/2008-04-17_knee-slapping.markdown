---
I occasionally see it claimed, <a href="http://michelleandraahool.weddingannouncer.com/bridalparty.html">absurdly</a>, that I'm the only human being who actually slaps his knee when he laughs.  This is untrue.  Knee-slapping actually runs in my family, and when my brother, father and I are feeling jolly we occasionally break out spontaneously into a knee-slapping fun-fest.  In marrying Yoon I have also done as much as I could to ensure that any offspring we produce, should we produce offspring, are knee-slappers, since Yoon is at least as much a knee-slapper as I am.  It's especially easy to observe this if you tell her a poo-poo-pee-pee joke and then stand back a few feet.  The typical result is not just knee-slapping, but finger-snapping too thrown in as an added bonus.

The knee slap runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned

Oh I kneeslap every now and again I think, but only when sitting. You don't do stand-up knee-slap, do you? Unconscionable!

And i take it we really mean thigh-slap? Knee-slapping sounds sore and dangerous.

Oh Kegri, don't be like that.

It's the red-faced, fallen on the ground, lying on your side and slapping your knee laughter that is a little over the top.

I'm picturing Chris and Yoon trapped in an escalating knee-slap chain-reaction until some terrified music student knocks on the door days later and finds them, exhausted and dehydrated, still feebly gesturing at their knees.

Certainly the Olive Loaf Vigilante inspired such laughter, but I don't know if Yoon would fall (literally) for such juvenilia .
