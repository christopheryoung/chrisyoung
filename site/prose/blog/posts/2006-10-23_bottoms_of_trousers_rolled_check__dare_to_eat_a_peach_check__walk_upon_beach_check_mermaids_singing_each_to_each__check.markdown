Fucking hell, my hip hurts.  Again.  And I'm only 33.  What's up with that?

Update: And don't you dare tell me to stretch after I exercise!  I hate stretching!  Grumblegrumbleyoukidsgetoffamylawngrumblegrumble.

Oh sure and you criticized my hip injury!  It was a syndrome!  A real syndrome!  And now who's all crying like a baby!

I'm convinced you faked that injury so that your insurance would cover 12 months of inner thigh massage.

I catagorically deny that accusation!!!!  Snapping Hip Syndrome is a serious medical ailment!  Anyway, my insurance covers me for therapeutic (go to the Dr. and get a prescription for massage for a sore neck) massage from any registered massage therapist.  Don't you wish you had comprehensive health care?
