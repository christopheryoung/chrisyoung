Samuel Delaney. *Babel-17*

This novel is basically 'What if Sapir-Whorf, but a *lot* and for aliens, and
with telepathy also thrown into the mix?' There were a few moments of interest
in the book, but the story was meh and the handling of ideas struck me as
distractingly clumsy. I've been looking forward to reading Delaney for years,
since he's been recommended to me by people I trust. Perhaps I just started
with the wrong book.

Alyssa Ney. *Metaphysics: An Introduction (Second Edition)*

This is a great introduction to contemporary metaphysics, about as accessible
as it's possible to be while still engaging in the substance of contemporary
debates. Ney is wonderfully clear and fair-minded in her presentation of a
well-organized selection of topics. I was struck by how much material was
updated between the two editions (the first in 2014, the second in 2023).

Peter Smith. *An Introduction to Formal Logic.*

Continuing my theme of back-to-the-basics-after-a-long-time-away, *this* is a
great introduction to formal logic, clear and accessible throughout. Smith
generously makes the book [available on his
site](https://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/), along with a number of his other
texts, including *Beginning Mathematical Logic: A Study Guide*. That text,
which I'm reading now, is filled with great advice for next steps after Smith's
introduction.
