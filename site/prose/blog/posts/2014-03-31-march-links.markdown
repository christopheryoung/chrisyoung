Not new this month, but I came across this post in which Rortybomb writes about
the Black Panthers' most alarming activity, from J. Edgar Hoover's point of
view:
[a free lunch program for children](http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2012/01/19/mental-note-link-black-panther-free-lunch-program-ows-infrastructure/).

Also not new this month, but new to me: A
[long piece](http://www.bostonreview.net/steinberg.php) on the "culture of
poverty".

And as a nice companion to the above piece, Jamelle Bouie
[explains](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/13/how-we-built-the-ghettos.html)
how we built the ghettos.

A reporter describes
[his time as a retail worker](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/03/my-life-as-a-retail-worker-nasty-brutish-and-poor/284332/)
after he is forced out of his profession.

A professor describes
[life on the academic job market](http://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2014/03/10/essay-about-inability-find-tenure-track-job-academe).

And a young chemist [explains her decision to leave academia](http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/i-didn-t-want-to-lean-out).

Robert Wolff
[republishes an old review](http://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/2014/03/yet-another-bauble-from-my-files.html)
of Allan Bloom's *Closing of the American
Mind* on his blog.

Andrew Gellman
[rehashes an old post](http://andrewgelman.com/2014/03/20/candy-weighing-demonstration-unwisdom-crowds/)
about an effective pedagogical technique to teach about problems with sampling.
