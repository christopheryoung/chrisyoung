Thanks to the miracle of lapsing copyright, here is Yoon's E String Band performing <a href="/media/explananda/afteryouvegone.mp3">After You've Gone</a> (Music and lyrics by Henry Creamer and Turner Layton (1918)).  They only had an hour and a half to record a quick demo, so they just raced through a bunch of songs.  Still, I think it's got a nice energy.

Damn, but they're good. Are they making a new record?

Thanks!

That particular band (The E String Band) hasn't made any official recordings yet.  The mp3 I put up was a demo to try to get gigs and to apply for a grant.  It's so expensive to make and produce a recording that I'm afraid it'll have to wait.

Yoon is also doing a duo project now with a pianist.  She just recorded an album of songs by Joe Raposo.  That's their second album, the first being <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/yoonjacob" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

And she just released an album with the quintet 4inObjects, which is <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/4inobjects" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

All the projects are very different, as you can see by clicking on the samples on those pages.  The E String Band does mainly covers of everything from Hank Williams to Cindi Lauper.  The duo does a lot of original music and free improvisation, including some really, really odd stuff (e.g., atonal, free).  And 4inObjects is sort of a mix of those two.

The recording quality is terrible, but I put up two other mp3s and wrote about them <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/001530.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It's such a pity that I can't even post low-quality recordings of live stuff, but Yoon is terrified of getting in trouble for copyright infringement.
