Cuconato, S. (2022). Impegno ontologico e l’argomento di indispensabilità in
filosofia della matematica. : Il Sileno Edizioni.

I read this booklet (main text is 63 pages) because it's in a current area of
interest, [was freely
downloadable](https://www.ilsileno.it/edizioni/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Cuconato_Il-Sileno-Edizioni.pdf),
and gave me a chance to practice my Italian. As the title suggests, it's about
the relationship between ontological commitment and indispensability arguments
in mathematics. The goal of the booklet doesn't seem to be to break any new
ground on these subjects, but rather to explicate and clarify. With a few
qualifications that I'll get to, it would make a nice introduction to the
subject for readers of Italian.

Start with indispensability: If we wish to inventory the universe in the
broadest sense, it's natural to begin with a notably successful human endeavor,
science. Our best scientific theories explain by positing entities and
relationships between them, and we might think that if the theories themselves
are justified, then so too are the entities they posit.

But scientific theories happen to be stated using quite a bit of mathematics,
and mathematics is filled with claims that are also stated in existential
language ("There *is* exactly one prime number"). Well, if existential language
then perhaps . . . existents? But mathematical objects, if they exist, are even
stranger than quarks: non-spatio-temporal and acausal, yet somehow supposedly
accessible to and discoverable by the wet gunk in your skull. But if we can't
state a scientific theory without all that math, isn't the math part of the
theory itself and so tangled up with its overall commitments? The Quine-Putnam
Indispensability Thesis is just the argument that we're justified in believing
what our best scientific theories say exist, our best scientific theories
*include* mathematics as an indispensable part, so taking our best scientific
theories of the world seriously requires us to recognize mathematical objects,
however strange, among the things that exist.

This quick and inadequate sketch of the position has flown by a number of
critical choicepoints and doesn't really convey how much work it is to develop
this view into something respectable. The relation between mathematics and the
scientific theories that draw on it has been an area of fierce controversy in
analytic metaphysics, especially over the last 75 years. Quine himself held a
strong version of confirmational holism, which makes mathematics and science
(and philosophy, etc.) out to be parts of one continuous whole, standing or
falling together, but this view (which helps to motivate Quine-Putnam
indispensability) has largely fallen out of favour.

More enduring (though still endlessly disputed) is Quine's attempt to give a
more rigorous way of understanding ordinary language existential claims, to
clarify which ones are genuinely ontologically committing and which ones are
not. The role this plays in Quine-Putnam indispensability arguments is to
provide a particular, precise way of understanding exactly when ordinary
language claims are and are not committing. In a nutshell, Quine's strategy is
to regiment ordinary language discourse into classical first-order predicate
logic and then read off the ontological commitments of the discourse from the
domain. The existential quantifier that we meet in first year logic classes
becomes the star of the show here, capturing no more or less than what
philosophy can hope to say about existence.

Cuconato begins with indispensability and various ways of formulating the view,
pans out to situate it in broader historical context, and then looks at Quine's
specific criterion of ontological commitment and later neo-Quinean approaches
like van Inwagen's. It's a lot to cover in 63 pages, but the basics are pretty
well covered. Usually, they're covered in a way friendly to relative beginners,
though there are a few places that made me wonder about the intended audience.
E.g., the quick definition of completeness on p. 50, or the amount of detail in
Cuconato's exposition of Field's attempt to nominalize a fragment of Newtonian
physics. There were also a few places where the book had the feel of something
condensed from a much longer text in ways that hurt clarity. One example: I
thought the page devoted to Church's alternative approach to Quinean commitment
was a bit tricky to follow and not well integrated with the rest of the text.

Perhaps the biggest reservation I had is that in giving a nice survey of
Quinean metaontology the booklet risks leaving an unsuspecting reader with a
distorted sense of the full range of live metaontological alternatives to
Quine. Quinean metaontology was without question *the* dominant approach for
the second half of the twentieth century. But by the mid 90s, it all started to
fall apart. There's no mention in Cuconato's survey of Thomasson or easy
ontology, of Yablo, of Hirsh's quantifier variance or any of the other broadly
neo-Carnapian alternatives to Quine that have flourished since Quine's
dominance started to recede (indeed, no mention anywhere of Carnap, an
important foil and influence for Quine as he developed his own views). A single
paper of Azzouni's made it into the bibliography but is not actually cited in
the main text. Cuconato's historical survey mentions the Aristotelian tradition
and its view of categories of being as a significant alternative to Quine's
approach to existence, but he does not mention McDaniel's and Turner's 21st
century revival of ontological pluralism. As the book closes, Cuconato mentions
the flatness of Quine's ontology, guesting at the now-vast 21st century
literature on grounding and dependence. But a beginner could easily miss a) how
many alternatives to Quinean metaontology have emerged in the last 30 years;
and b) how far out of favour Quine's metaontology has fallen, in spite of
(inevitably) some hold outs.

It would be churlish and unfair to complain that a booklet fails to cover all
these topics outside of its main theme (especially when it succeeds in being so
wide-ranging). So let me clarify that this is not what I'm trying to do! My
suggestion is just that it would have been good to briefly situate Quinean
metaontology in this broader context in order to give readers a fuller sense of
the options in the space, and to underline that, especially as this century has
unfolded, Quinean metaontology has gone from being the "standard view" to being
something more like the underdog.

Two minor points: First, shouldn't "o che il vocabolario di 𝑆 è indispensabile
per 𝑆" on p. 53 be "o che il vocabolario di 𝑇 è indispensabile per 𝑆"? Second,
(not of course in any way a criticism of Cuconato) Cuconato mentions Malament's
point against Field that quantum mechanics makes indispensable reference to
complex numbers. By coincidence, while reading Cuconato I happened to notice
[this development from
2025](https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-take-the-imaginary-numbers-out-of-quantum-mechanics-20251107/).
I'm not currently qualified to judge the dispute, but it made me wonder if
Malament's influential line of argument might need to be updated.
