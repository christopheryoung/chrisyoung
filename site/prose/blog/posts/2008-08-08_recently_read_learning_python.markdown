<strong>Mark Lutz. <em>Learning Python</em></strong>

When I was studying philosophy, I didn't bother to review philosophy books here.  Likewise, I don't now intend to write much about computer books.  But I'll make an exception for Mark Lutz's <em>Learning Python</em>.  I was told a while back by several people that Python is a great programming language to get started with.  It's elegant, powerful, free, easy to pick up, and currently in fairly widespread use.  As far as I can tell, this was good advice.  I've certainly enjoyed the time I've spent playing around with Python, and I've found the experience strangely empowering.  There are all kinds of uses for simple programs in daily life, and it's wonderful to be able to whip them up yourself.  Picking up a little programming is something that I recommend to just about anyone, including people who never thought of themselves as likely programmers.  If, then, you want to dabble a bit, and you take the advice given to me to begin with Python, go get yourself Lutz's book.  It is readable, extraordinarily clear, and patient.  I suspect that at times the pace is slow enough to drive someone with an actual programming background nuts, but this turns out to be very handy if you're new to programming.  Highly recommended.
