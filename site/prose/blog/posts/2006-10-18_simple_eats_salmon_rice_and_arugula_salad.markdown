	salad', tags: food}

---
Nick came over for a cooking lesson tonight.  Nick has terrible memory, no patience, very bad diet, and lotsa ladies, so I wanted a dish that was easy, fast, nutritious and could double as a meal for a date in a pinch.  Tell me if this is not simplicity itself:

1.  Rice. Put it in the rice cooker and forget about it.
2.  Salmon fillet.  Rinse under cold water, then coat liberally with salt and pepper.  Heat up the frying pan with some oil (best is safflower oil, since it handles high heat very well) and slap on the fillet, scales down.  Cover with a lid, and then cook for about 10 minutes on medium low heat.  Check that it's done by making a cut in the salmon so that you can see that it's cooked all the way through.  No need to flip it if you've got that lid on and you cook it long enough.  Serve with a splash of lemon.
3.  While the salmon is cooking, put some arugula in a salad bowl.  If you've washed it, make sure that the argulua is dry.  Add some olive oil, a splash of lemon, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and pepper.

Done!  Takes 15 minutes if you're moving sluggishly, not counting the rice cooking time.  It also tastes good, and the pink/white/green arrangement on the plate is pleasing to the eye.

No doubt any amount of nutriance is good for Nick.  However, I would suggest not cooking a good piece of salmon that long.  Salmon should be cooked to the rare side of medium really.  A good way is to sear the flesh side and then flip onto the skin side (skin, not scales...the fishmonger should have gotten rid of the scales making the skin edible) and then stick the entire (oven proof) skillet into a 350 degree oven for 5 mins (depending on thickness).  Good to hear Nick is eating though.

Oh, sorry!  Must not have been scales, since that scaly-lookin' part was edible.  Also, not sure if Nick has an oven proof skillet.  Remember: I had to work with a bachelor's kitchen instruments.

I must have gotten some of Yoon's paranoia about undercooking things.

I grudgingly admit to sharing Spaz's admonitions about overcooking salmon.  BTW - does Niki have a rice cooker?

When are you going to post your famous scotch eggs recipe?

Kegri,
Nick does have a rice cooker, I think.  In fact, I thought he told me that you made fun of him for it, since it wasn't up to your high, high Asian standards.

Kegri and Spaz,
Fu-Q!!!

I have to say, of all the things I've seen you guys bicker about, finer points of fancy home cooking is definitely the sexiest.

Oh sure, to you we're all just a bunch of hunky chefs willing to do your gastronomic bidding!  We have feelings you know!

Btw, Chris, by rice I hope you mean basmati...the king of rice.

Anne,
That's just because my fitness blogging has hitherto not included photographs.

Spaz,
Dude, I'm an honourary Asian.  Give it up on the basmati, will ya?

Basmati rice is the stuff of legend...it fights the power, don't try to bring it down!

I'm with spaz on both counts. Basmati rules, and Chris, I don't think I could take it if you posted fitness pictures of yourself. Take that how you will.
Foooood pictures, on the other hand...

Scotch Eggs
Cook it British!
Favourite British Recipes
Brian Turner's Favourite British Recipes

So fattening but so good! This recipe makes 6 Scotch eggs.

6 hard-cooked eggs, well chilled
1 pound breakfast sausage
1/2 cup flour
2 eggs, beaten
3/4 cup fine bread crumbs
Vegetable oil for frying

Peel eggs and set aside. Divide sausage into 6 portions. Roll each egg in flour and with hands press a portion of the sausage around each egg.

Dip sausage-wrapped eggs into beaten eggs and roll in bread crumbs. Heat vegetable oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

Cook each egg in oil about 4-5 minutes or until sausage is cooked and browned. Drain on paper toweling. Serve warm to your ungrateful progeny.

<a href="/media/explananda/ew.jpg" rel="nofollow">Kegri</a>,
I've told you guys about stupid in-jokes before.  For those not versed in Chris-lore, when I was in grade 2 (that is, 7 or 8), my parents cooked scotch eggs, which are revolting, for dinner.  I refused to eat, so was sentenced to sit at the table until they were eaten.  After an hour or so, I worked out a secret deal with my brother to ferry the eggs across the kitchen to the garbage.  But our security was lax, the plot detected, and I was sent to my room, and spanked until contrite.  And that is how I grew up to be a hater of scotch eggs.  And lies.

Anne,
Sad, but not surprising.  It seems that DC is the only one around here to <a href="http://www.explananda.com/archives/001535.html#comments" rel="nofollow">really encourage</a> my fitness activities.  I'll have to send pictures to him privately, by email.

Chris,

Re. Scotch eggs...it is a bit of a mystery that you haven't gotten over this by now.  Clearly you have a strong affinity for eggs, sausage, and deep fried foods.  I think perhaps it's time to let go of some childhood horrors and face your fears.  I think you might find you will enjoy a fine Scottish breakie tradition.  It is afterall a part of your personal heritage.

Re. your fitness...nobody who comments here is not encouraging of your better health.  We simply want to be able to read our morning Explananda and eat our Scotch eggs in peace, without pic-posts of your physic making us spray coffee on our screens.  We also want to encourage Nick's health and not intimidate him with your burly muscles.
