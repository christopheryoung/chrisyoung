From Patrick Leigh Fermor's <i>Mani: Travels in the Southern Peloponnese</i>,
p. 116:<blockquote>No pirate enterprise of any consequence was complete without
a priest. He blessed the expedition at its outset, prayed for fair weather for
his parent ship and foul weather for the enemy and interceded for the souls of
his fallen messmates. He absolved the sins of his floating flock and saw to it
that a share of the loot, often wet with blood, was hung besides the ikons on
the mainmast as a votive offering. If more than eight days passed and no prize
came their way, he would intone a litany on the deck, and when a prospective
prize was sighted he would level a matchlock over the bulwarks with the rest
and join the boarding party with khanjar and scimitar.</blockquote>I was put
onto Fermor by Anthony Lane's recent piece on him in the <i>New Yorker</i>.
<i>Mani</i> also (in chapter 8) has a nice discussion of feuding in the
Southern Peloponnese. Ever since I read Russell Hardin's <i>One for All: The
Logic of Group Conflict</i>, I've been meaning to read more about feuding,
especially in Albania. I'm looking forward to comparing Albanian feuding with
feuding in the Southern Peloponnese, in the unlikely event I ever find the
time.
