Because I'm perpetually broke, I almost never fly, so it's still a real novelty for me.  I just flew back to NYC today from a conference in Toronto (ticket paid for by the conference!) and got a wonderful view of Manhattan as we flew along the length of it and then over Brooklyn.  Flying over Brooklyn I could see the first place we lived here, but not the second or our current place, which were on the other side of the plane.  On the way to Toronto, we flew almost directly over the Niagara Falls, which was kind of cool.

Anyway, as I recently said to a friend, I love flying partly because it makes me feel so grownup to be in airports and on planes, and partly because plane go zoom zoom in sky.

It was more convoluted than it needed to be. But in general I got some good questions that will help me make progress on the issue. So that's good. And the topic was win/win: How can anyone think that there is no such thing as global justice?? I mean, REALLY!
