	persist" Edition), tags: fitness}

My new gym has a punching bag and a <a
href="http://www.speedbagcentral.com/">speed bag</a>. Both are awfully
difficult to use without looking like a tool. The speed bag is also difficult
to use without looking like a dweeb, if, like me, you lack the co-ordination to
get the rhythm right. (On the top of that, I think the bag is a bit
underinflated.)

And yet I persist.
