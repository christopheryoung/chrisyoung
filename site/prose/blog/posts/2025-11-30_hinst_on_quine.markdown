Hinst, P. (1983). "Quines Ontologiekriterium." *Erkenntnis* (1975), 19(1/3),
193–215.

I read and write philosophy every day, but rarely publish any work in progress
here. I'd like to change that by adding brief notes on some of the papers and
books that I'm reading. This is the first in what I hope is a series.

I read this paper partly because it's central to my current project
(understanding Quine's metaontology and responses to it) but also just to
practice my German. I found it worth reading even though I stumbled across it
randomly, especially considering that as of this writing Google Scholar lists a
single English language citation of this paper and four citations in total (one
of which appears to be deranged AI slop).

The paper is divided into two parts. The first simply aims to give Quine's
criterion of ontological commitment a reasonably rigorous formulation. This is
a fairly technical discussion in which Hinst develops a first candidate, notes
that it generates much broader commitments than intended, and then formulates a
more precise version.

The second part of the paper argues against Quine's claim that the existential
quantifier has any ontological significance at all. Hinst complains that the
basic move in Quine's Tarskian semantics here is to assume a particular
interpretation of quantifiers in the metalanguage (not, if I understand
correctly, one that is actually shared by Tarski himself!), without adequate
justification. To interpret the metalanguage domain this way is a choice, and
not forced us on by any considerations that Quine appeals to. It's that choice
that makes the object language existential quantifier appear ontologically
significant.

Anyway, this is a point that I associate most with Jody Azzouni. See, e.g., p.
xii and the appendix to the General Introduction of his *Ontology Without
Borders*, where he stresses the smae thing. At the moment, I can't find the
exact passage where Azzouni discusses the literature on this issue, but my
recollection is that he thinks this is a widely neglected. That may be, but
Hinst's paper is a nice and overlooked precedent for it.

Hinst concludes with a few observations about the failure (as he sees it) of
Quine's criterion: that since it fails it doesn't provide him with a clear way
to demarcate nominalism from alternatives; that with the collapse of Quine's
criterion we lose some of the motivation for the development of free logic. And
finally, he advocates for a distinct regimented existence predicate, which he
believes can handle negative existentials and other problems just as well.
