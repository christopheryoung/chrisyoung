Periodic convulsions seem to be in the nature of capitalist economies. The
catastrophe of the Great Depression still looms so large in the popular
imagination that it's easy to forget that it was only one of many busts to
follow a boom. Collapse has always been accompanied by social upheaval,
sometimes of sufficient intensity to shake the very foundations of the system.
Our most recent economic catastrophe shuddered through the system in 2008, yet
 popular unrest was muted in comparison to previous crises. Why?

Aladair Roberts's *The End of Protest* is a look at this recent history through
a broader historical lens. He identifies four general strategies governments
might take to the social and economic upheaval: do nothing; repress protest;
contain it; appease it, by retreating from free market principles. Capitalist
governments have experimented with a mix of all four of these strategies at
different times.

Looks back to Schumpeter. Schumpeter argued that capitalism was inherently
unstable and warned, from the position of an advocate, that the flaw might
prove fatal.



The development of neoliberalism:

Myth of stable, efficient markets persisted up to 2008. The crisis proved that
neoliberals "had vastly underestimated the potential for unrest that laid
within the free-market model."



captures the ironies well. The neoliberal project of dismantling the social
safety net has not been completely successful---lucky for the neoliberal
project, since what remains of our safety net helped to contain unrest during
the crisis.
