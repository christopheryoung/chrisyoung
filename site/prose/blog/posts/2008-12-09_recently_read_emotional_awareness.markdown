<strong>The Dalai Lama and Paul Ekman.  <em>Emotional Awareness: Overcoming the Obstacles to Psychological  Balance and Compassion</em></strong>

This book presents a series of dialogues between the well-known psychologist and researcher of facial expressions, Paul Ekman, and the Dalai Lama.  I'm not sure how deeply they really manage to get into their topic, or whether this book was very helpful in allowing me to "overcome obstacles to psychological balance and compassion," but the discussions are interesting nonetheless.  It's clear that a lot of care has gone into this book, as it contains not only dialogues but well-written guest-authored sidebars throughout containing further explanations about particular issues.
