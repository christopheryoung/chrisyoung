title: Woolf on Writing
---

> "Anyone moderately familiar with the rigours of composition will not need to
> be told the story in detail; how he wrote and it seemed good; read and it
> seemed vile; corrected and tore up; cut out; put in; was in ecstasy; in
> despair; had his good nights and bad mornings; snatched at ideas and lost
> them; saw his book plain before him and it vanished; acted his people's parts
> as he ate; mouthed them as he walked; now cried; now laughed; vacillated
> between this style and that; now preferred the heroic and pompous; next the
> plain and simple; now the vales of Tempe; then the fields of Kent or
> Cornwall; and could not decide whether he was the divinest genius or the
> greatest fool in the world."

Virginia Woolf, *Orlando*
