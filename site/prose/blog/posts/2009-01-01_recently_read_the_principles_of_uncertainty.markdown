<strong>Maira Kalman. <em>The Principles of Uncertainty</em></strong>

The first thing I noticed about this book when I picked it up was its weight.
It's much heavier than is normal for a book of its size, a solidly put together
book with nice, thick pages. <em>The Principles of Uncertainty</em> takes us
through a year of the author's musings, free associations, memories and
travels, from May 2006 to April 2007. There are a few pictures, and an
accompanying text, but the main attractions are the illustrations, which are
gorgeous and wonderful to look at. The accompanying text is occasionally
effective, but I often found it a bit too cutesy for my taste. On the whole,
though, this book was a real pleasure to read, and will, I expect, be a
pleasure to dip back into from time to time.
