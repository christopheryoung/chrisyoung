to the claim that Snowden is morally obliged to return to the U.S. to face
justice.

Carlos Bueno [writes about](http://carlos.bueno.org/2014/06/mirrortocracy.html)
Silicon Valley's "mirrortocracy":

> You have to wonder why intelligent people would devise an interview process
> so strange & oblique that the candidate doesn't even know it's happening.

[gentrification and racial arbitrage](http://www.peterfrase.com/2014/06/gentrification-and-racial-arbitrage/):

Jill Lepore (or "Jill" as she is known to her friends and also, [apparently](http://valleywag.gawker.com/the-guy-who-coined-disruption-is-a-total-jackass-1593900425), to

Via [Steve Laniel](http://stevereads.com/), a great post,
[What Elites Do Instead of Providing Services](http://pedestrianobservations.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/what-elites-do-instead-of-providing-services/):

Click through for some great examples. I've added this blog to my RSS feeds.

Finally, I hope
[this](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/06/23/323330486/how-a-womans-plan-to-kill-herself-helped-her-family-grieve)
is the way I go.

By the way, if you like link round ups check out Gerry Canavan's
[blog](http://gerrycanavan.wordpress.com/), which is the source of some of the
links that make it into my own link round ups (I can't remember which).
