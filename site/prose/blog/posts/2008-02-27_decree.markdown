It often happens in phone conversations, especially those involving a cell phone, that the connection will be suddenly lost.  Both parties to the conversation will then try to call the other back at the same time.  Or both will wait for the other to call, because they are trying to avoid calling at the same time.  Or both will wait, then call at the same time, then wait, and so on.  If they had had some warning, they might have coordinated this ahead of time.  But, alas, that's the problem with suddenly dropped calls.

Therefore, I decree that henceforth the person who initiates the original call shall initiate a new connection in the event of a dropped connection.

I estimate that strict adherence to this rule will save 900 million minutes a year of lost productivity in North America alone.

At least two friends and I have been relying on the "original caller calls back" rule for years.

Note also that I will occasionally end phone calls that I find annoying by pretending that the connection is bad. I hereby reveal my trickery to the world.

no - i use a much clearer and more effective rule.  whoever is at fault with regards to a terminated connection must call back.  saves me a bundle on long distance!

it's not more effective. 1/2 the time neither side has any idea who is at fault for the dropped connection. or rather, each thinks the other was probably at fault. under the kegri rule, no one ever calls anyone back. instead everyone sits and fumes that that asshole who cut them off isn't trying to redial.

Upyernoz,
I'm afraid that your lack of experience dealing with Kegri is showing through.  For him that's a feature, not a bug.

Do you see what I had to live with all those years?  That kind of comment, not to mention Kegri's disgraceful behaviour on the Czech border in 1993.

I kinda think he's funny.  But, I wasn't at the Czech border in 1993.
