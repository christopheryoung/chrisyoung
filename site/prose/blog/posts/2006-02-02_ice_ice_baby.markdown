Depends on Dinner</i></a>, p. 292: <blockquote>The Norwegians cut ice and sold
it to most of Europe during the nineteenth century. In 1822, when the first
Norwegian ice cargo arrived in Britain, it caused consternation at the customs
house, becuase it did not fit into classification lists for import duties. By
the time it was decided that ice was "dry goods," the whole cargo had
liquefied.</blockquote>

It's not my fault I'm lame.  I blame George Bush for this, as I blame him for everything else.
