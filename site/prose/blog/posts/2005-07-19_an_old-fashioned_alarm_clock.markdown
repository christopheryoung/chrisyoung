From Thomas Hardy's <i>The Mayor of Casterbridge</i>: <blockquote>Poor
Abel, as he was called, had an inveterate habit of over-sleeping himself and
coming late to his work. His anxious will was to be among the earliest; but if
his comrades omitted to pull the string that he always tied round his great toe
and left hanging out of the window for that purpose, his will was as
wind.</blockquote>
