Whew!  Busy, busy.  But at least I can read on the subway on my way to work.

<strong>Adrienne Mayor.  <em>The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates, Rome's Deadliest Enemy</em></strong>

Rome fought four wars---the so-called Mithradatic wars---against Mithradates in the first century B.C.  The wily, resourceful Mithradates makes such a perfect subject, and the story of his setbacks and accomplishments is so much fun, that I'm surprised that Hollywood hasn't been all over him.  Perhaps now they will be.  Mayor tells his story with real verve.  Mithradates was especially famed for his extensive toxicological investigations---for practical reasons he was very interested in how to poison others and how to build up immunity to poisons that others might use on him---and Mayor, an expert in ancient toxicology, is especially well-suited to relate this part of the story.  Where the evidence grows thin, at the beginning and the ends of Mithradates' life in particular, Mayor allows herself speculative passages that might have been more suitable to a historical novel.  But that's partly just a matter of taste, and these passages are usually marked out very clearly as speculative.  This book is recommended.

<strong>Janice Gross Stein and Eugene Lang.  <em>The Unexpected War: Canada in Kandahar</em></strong>

Solid, though now somewhat dated (published 2007), account of Canada's involvement in Afghanistan.  Emphasizes the extent to which policy was not really driven by larger strategic considerations, but rather emerged through a series of accidents.  My only complaint is that the book might be a bit opaque to readers unfamiliar with Canadian politics.  This is a pity, since I think it would be <em>really</em> useful for Americans to have a sense of what the war looks like from the perspective of a close coalition partner.

<strong>Edward Gorey. <em>Men and Gods: Myths and Legends of the Ancient Greeks</em></strong>

This book is a children's classic published in 1950 and recently resurrected by the New York Review of Books in their excellent children's series.  The stories are well told, though it dragged in places.  That might just be me, though---I've never had much interest in Greek myth.  A chart at the back helps the reader keep track of Latin equivalents of Greek gods and heros, but there is no introduction explaining why Gorey chose to use the Latin equivalents in the first place.

<strong>F&eacute;lix F&eacute;n&eacute;on. <em>Novels in Three Lines</em></strong>

This is a collection of three line news summaries written by F&eacute;n&eacute;on for a French newspaper over the course of 1906.  The summaries occasionally touch on politics, but they're mostly about every day pieces of news: suicides, burglaries, assaults, and accidents.  This might sound monotonous---and actually I would recommend that people not try to read the book through cover to cover without a break---but F&eacute;n&eacute;on's summaries are, as the title of the book suggests, absolute masterpieces of compression.  F&eacute;n&eacute;on was an anarchist and an important behind-the-scenes literary and cultural figure in late nineteenth and early twentieth century France.  He wrote little and the contents of this book were only saved for posterity by lucky chance.

The preface was published in the New York Review of Books, and I thought it sounded really interesting.  Here's a sample:
