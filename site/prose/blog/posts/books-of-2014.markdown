## **Alasdair Roberts, *The End of Protest: How Free-Market Capitalism Learned To Control Dissent***

[![The End of Protest](/media/book_covers/end_of_protest.jpg)](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100222390)

Periodic convulsions seem to be in the nature of capitalist economies. The
catastrophe of the Great Depression still looms so large in the popular
imagination that it's easy to forget that it was only one of many busts to
follow a boom. Collapse has always been accompanied by social upheaval,
sometimes of sufficient intensity to shake the very foundations of the system.
Our most recent economic catastrophe shuddered through the system in 2008, yet
 popular unrest was muted in comparison to previous crises. Why?

Aladair Roberts's *The End of Protest* is a look at this recent history through
a broader historical lens. He identifies four general strategies governments
might take to the social and economic upheaval: do nothing; repress protest;
contain it; appease it, by retreating from free market principles. Capitalist
governments have experimented with a mix of all four of these strategies at
different times.

Looks back to Schumpeter. Schumpeter argued that capitalism was inherently
unstable and warned, from the position of an advocate, that the flaw might
prove fatal.

The development of neoliberalism:

Myth of stable, efficient markets persisted up to 2008. The crisis proved that
neoliberals "had vastly underestimated the potential for unrest that laid
within the free-market model."

captures the ironies well. The neoliberal project of dismantling the social
safety net has not been completely successful---lucky for the neoliberal
project, since what remains of our safety net helped to contain unrest during
the crisis.

# Choire Sicha's Very Recent History: An Entirely Factual Account of a Year (c. AD 2009) in a Large City

[![Very Recent History cover](/media/book_covers/very_recent_history.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780061914300-2)

-The large city is New York
-novel of social criticism.
-As told to some distant future audience
-The general instability and scrounging of lives in a city dominated by the
-wealthy. The college debt and medical bill debt
-Not sure he had a clear conception of the audience

-p. 25 "Most people at this time ate meat. The opinion regarding the treatment
of animals by humans, in order of what was considered most evil to most
unremarkable, went: the ivory trade, which was the slaughter of elephants in a
distant land for their tusks; animal medical experimentation; the skinning and
wearing of fur; industrial meat farming; meat eating; dairy farms; petting
zoos; zoos; the eating of eggs; the drinking of milk; the keeping of household
pets."

p. 20: "Some people could achieve sexual intimacy with only one particular
gender. Most people are this time believed there were two of those. And many
believed these two genders were very distinct---almost separate species---and
so they should have different roles in life. Many, though, found this
ridiculous."

p. 34 gold or silver "which were chemical elements that were found in the
ground."

p. 98 no explanation of "hipster jeans"

p. 145: "Chad was becoming Joni Mitchell-friends with Edward. That meant he'd
IM with Edward and they'd talk about Joni Mitchell."

p 186: sample
Kevin had grown an enormous brushy mustache. "I was saying, does this tear off?
And he got so upset! He was like, no, I just grew it." John said. "I was like,
it looks good, and he was like, okay."
"I'm going to take a vacation. I'm going to take like three days off next week.
Whatever," John said.

[![The Golden Ticket](/media/book_covers/golden_ticket.jpg)]()

Had been looking forward to book; a little disappointing.

Moves too quickly over issues while lingering over other tangential issues
A little sloppy in places.

p.2: "A typical laptop can process about a trillion operations a second" (the
correct number, a billion, is given on p. 33)

p. 36: "Path, Trees and Flowers" should be Paths

p. 83 has Novosibirsk  1750 miles *West* of Moscow (or "west" uncapitalized).

p. 74: On halting problem: "no computer can look at some code of a program and
determine whether the code will run forever or eventually halt"  That seems
likely to mislead a beginner into thinking that there no program that could
inspect *any* program and determine whether it will halt. But of course there
are many, many programs that we can say will halt (e.g., print "hello world" in
Python). We could write a simple program to detect loops and then say with
confidence that such a program composed simply of non-looping statements will
halt after the execution of the statements. It seems important to explain that
we could always *craft* program input that will be impossible for a second
program to settle whether it will halt in a finite amount of time.

p. 74 : "All programming languages are functionally equivalent, and all can
compute exactly what can be computed by the simple Turing machine." The word
"functionally" seems especially helpful here. Perhaps "effectively" would have
done the trick better. The fact that "all programming languages" is unexplained
is the real problem here. A beginning might wonder what makes a programming
language a full fledged programming language. E.g., why, the beginnger might
wonder, is html not a programming langauge but javascript is, when they both
use a bunch of funny text? (A good answer is that a programming language is a
fully fledged programming language when it is Turing complete, but now we've
closed a very tight circle). Fortnow punts on this issue, but it's a shame
since it matters to the book.

Book has a good overview of the stakes in N=NP, and some nice expository
passages.

## **Jo Walton, *My Real Children***
[![](/media/book_covers/my_real_children.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780765332653-2)

## **Art Spiegelman, *The Complete Maus: A Survivors Tale***
[![](/media/book_covers/complete_maus.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780679406419-0)

## **Michelle Alexander, *The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness ***
[![](/media/book_covers/new_jim_crow.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781595581037-20)

## **Charles Portis, *True Grit***

[![](/media/book_covers/true_grit.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781590204597-3)

## **Daniel Dennett, *Intuition Pumps and Other Tools For Thinking***

[![](/media/book_covers/intuition_pumps.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780393348781-6)

Dennett eschews convention, including the convention about repeating your own
zingers (I can never resist either).

Much of Dennett's considerable firepower goes to attacking opponents for views
I find implausible. It might be profess hazzard of a software developer, but I
can't see what the mind might be besides some sort of fancy computing device.
Dualism bonkers.

I haven't read Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea," so I'm not sure. Even
though he is only concerned to attack views I find stupid, and defend many
views I find congenial, I suspect the focus might obscure other disagreements.
One thing Dennett does not do is try to guard against the stupider blunders
that naive but enthusiastic people who take themselves to be Darwinian do
(extrapolative ev psych, social Darwinism, esp. naively drawing oughts from
is's here).

## **Thomas Geoghegan, *Which Side Are You On? Trying to Be For Labor When It's Flat on its Back***

[![](/media/book_covers/which_side_are_you_on.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-9781565848863-2)

## **Laurie Penny, *Unspeakable Things: Sex, Lies and Revolution***

[![](/media/book_covers/.jpg)]()

p. 2: "This is a book about love and sex in austerity, about gender under
neoliberalism. 'Neoliberalism' refers to the attempt to reorganize society and
the state on the basis of an ideal of 'the market'. Neoliberalism proclaims
that the logic of business and money is the best determinant of human
happiness."

p. 5: "The feminism that has mattered to the media and made magazine headlines
in recent years has been the feminism most useful to heterosexual, high-earning
middle- and upper-middle-class white women. Public 'career feminists' have been
more concerned with getting more women into 'boardrooms', when the problem is
that there are altogether too many boardrooms, and none of them are on fire."

-p. 60 tries to broaden the scope: "Feminism has never just been about
 liberating women from men, but about freeing every human being from the
 straightjacket of gender oppression. For the first time, men and boys as a
 whole are starting to realize how profoundly messed up masculinity is---and to
 ask how they might make it different."

p. 75: two big secrets about traditional masculine power: "The first big secret
is this: most men have never really been powerful. Throughout human history,
the vast majority of men have had almost no structural power, except over women
and children. In fact, power over women and children---technical and physical
domininance wthin the sphere of one's own home---has been the sop offered to
men who had almost no power outside of it." The second secret is that many men
never fit the standard in the first place.

p. 89: "Miley Cyrus is castigated for being a poor role model, but Justin
Bieber can trash all the hotel rooms he likes. He's young. He'll learn."

p. 100: "Let's be perfectly clear: we have created a society in which it is
structurally difficult and existentially stressful for any male person not to
behave like a complete and utter arsehole."

-she stresses the non-zero sum nature of the interactions between men and
 women.

p. 122: "Sexual objectification doesn't get oppressive until it is done
consistently, and to a specific group of people, and with no regard whatsoever
paid to their humanity. Then it ceases to be about desire and starts to be
about control. . . Structural sexual objection [sic] of women draws that
instant out into an entire matrix of hurt. It tells us that women are bodies
first, idealised, subservient bodies, and men are not."

p. 195: on ev psych: "It's a eugenics of gender that would be seen for the
throat-closingly vile propaganda it is were the tests being done on people of
different races, ethnicities or sexual preferences. And yet these myths persist
because they are soothing, comforting, because they provide a halfway rational
basis for the prejudices that poison our society. . . Otherwise rational
individuals cling to bad science to justify the . . . .in the same way that
people once clung to religion to provide the same justification . . . This is,
apart from anything else, a terrible misuse of a respected theory."

-Writing is more passionate than focused (though occasionally comes into great
 focus, as with the passage on sexual objectification). Impressionistic,
 sweeping. Presenting the world as she sees it. Describing more than arguing.


## **Annie Dillard, *Teaching a Stone to Talk: Expeditions and Encounters***

[![](/media/book_covers/.jpg)]()

p. 9 (Total Eclipse) - "It had been like dying, that sliding down the mountain
pass. It had been like the death of someone, irrational, that sliding down the
mountain pass and into the region of dread. It was like slipping into fever, or
falling down that hole in sleep from which you wake yourself wimpering. We had
crossed the mountains that day, and now we were in a strange place---a hotel in
central Washington, in a town near Yakima. The eclipse we had traveled here to
see would occur early the next morning."

p. 24 (Total Eclipse) - "The mind wants to live forever, or to learn a very good reason why
not. The mind wants the world to return its love, or its awareness; the mind
wants to know all the world, and all eternity, and God. The mind's sidekick,
however, will settle for two eggs over easy.
"The dear, stupid body is as easily satisfied as a spaniel. And, incredibly,
the simple spaniel can lure the brawling mind to its dish. It is everlastingly
funny that the proud, metaphysically ambitious, clamoring mind will hush if you
give it an egg."

incantory, repetetive
rueful, tricks of memory.

p. 73 (In the Jungle): "The point of going somewhere like the Napo River in Ecuador is not to
see the most spectacular anyting. It is simply to see what is there. We are
here on the planet only once, and might as well get a feel for the place. We
might as well get a feel for the fringes and hollows in which live is lived,
for the Amazon basin, which covers half the continent, and for the life
that---there, like anywhere else---is always and necessarily lived in detail:
on the tributaries, in the riverside villages, scking this particular
white-fleshed guava in this particular pattern of shade."

Out of date on molecular genetics.

- p.175 (Aces and Eights) : "A ripple of wind comes down from the woods and
  across the clearing toward us. We see a wave of shadow and gloss where the
  short grass bends and the cottage eaves tremble. It hits us in the back. It
  is a single gust, a sport, a rogue breeze out of the north, as if some
  reckless, impatient wind has bumped the north door open on its hinges and let
  out this acre of scent familiar and forgotten, this cool scent of tundra, and
  of November. Fall! Who authorized this intrusion? Stop or I'll shoot. It is
  an entirely misplaced air---fall, that I have utterly forgotten, that could
  be here again, <em>another</em> fall, and here it is only July. I thought I
  was younger, and would have more time. The gust crosses the river and
  blackens the water where it passes, like a finger closing slats."

## **Allen Shawn, *Wish I Could Be There: Notes From a Phobic Life***

[![Allen Shawn's Wish I Could Be There](/media/book_covers/wish_i_could_be_there.jpg)]()

p. 121: "The phobic not only becomes afraid of his own fearful thoughts but
also unconsciously believes that those very thoughts will bring about changes
in what happens. He believes, in a quasi-superstitious way, that because he is
afraid of the highway, it is more likely that a traffic jam will occur while he
is on it. (A very solipsistic view of life!) At the same time the actual
feelings and ideas stirred by the phobic response are completely rational; they
relate to the very real terrors of being a human being. And since they connect
with the real, they make the places and circumstances that so readily stimulate
them seem truly dangerous. Because of the associate powers of the mind, the
flavors of truth---the truth of our mortality and of life's
unpredictability---are folded into the dough of anticipatory and interpretive
fantasy. The daily bread of phobics is a strange mix of deep truth and magical
thinking."

p. 134: "The cognitive behavioral therapists made a momentous discovery in the
1980s, when they found that many people with agoraphobia and many specific
phobias have a fear of the physical and psychological effects of fear which is
stronger than their dread of the context in which they experience them. It
meant that the task of cure can in some cases be simplified into demystifying
fear, and learning not to aggravate its symptoms. After many years of being
told so, I have finally begun to understand that the tangled thoughts
accompanying my irrational fears are merely the sparks thrown off by the
grinding machinery of panic when it has no external cause."

## **Charles Bowden, *Down By the River: Drugs, Money, Murder, and Family***

[![](/media/book_covers/.jpg)]()

-p. 228: "The image in my head is always the same and hardly original since it
 is an image that in some variation comes to visitors who seek facts in Mexico:
 there is an onion, you keep peeling it to get to the center and when you get
 to the center there is nothing there, nothing at all, and you are left with
 this disorderly heap of peelings that now denies even the idea that it was
 once an onion."

-p. 258: "Carlos Salinas has his future sketched out as he approaches the end
 of his six-year term. He is a top candidate to head the new World Trade
 Organization. He is going on the board of the Dow Jones. He is celebrates in
 the world press. Britain's *The Economist* concludes, 'Mr. Salinas has a claim
 to be hailed as one of the great men of the twentieth century.' In 1992,
 *Time* magazine almost made him Man of the Year. Henry Kissinger in 1993
 offered that Salinas had 'quelled corruption and brought into office an
 extraordinary group of young, highly trained technocrats. I know of no
 government anywhere that is more competent.'"

-p. 4: "There are things---the gulag of slave labor camps in the former Soviet
 Union, the burning bodies of the Holocaust in Europe, the clanking chains of
 human bondage in the United States---that intelligent and honest pepole know
 occurred and yet grow weary of contemplating. The drug business is not like
 such things. Beyond some songs, a few action-packed movies, the drug business
 is never really acknowledged. Drugs may be the major American story of our
 era, the thing that did more to alter behavior and law, that redistributed
 income to the poor far more dramatically than any tinkering with tax codes,
 that jailed more people and killed more people than any U.S. foreign policy
 initiative since the Vietnam War. But this vital force, this full-tilt-boogie
 economic activity, is absent from our daily consciousness and only surfaces
 when discussed as a problem. And this problem is always placed on the other
 side of town or the other side of a line or the other side of the river."

-p. 7: "The official history is about the corruption of Mexico. The unwritten
 history, or the one that is almost instantly erased, is about the corruption
 of both nations. In this unwritten history, the drug merchants are almost the
 only honest players: vicious, greedy, murderous, and candid about their
 behavior. They are also the only real defenders of cutthroat capitalism since
 they literally cut throats and employ people based on their talents and with
 little regard to their sex, race, class, color, or religion. They are also one
 of the few industries in the developing sectors of the earth that really do
 redistribute income and do so at a level without parallel in the thousands of
 assembly plants now employing the poor of the planet."

Irvine, A Guide to the Good Life

* Keeps talking about 'evolutionary programming'.

* He can’t help that he doesn’t like spiders. “These examples suggest that Epictetus is wrong to include our impulses, desires, and aversions in the category of things over which we have complete control. They belong instead in the category of things over which we have some but not complete control, or, in some instances, in teh category of things over which we hae no control at all. But having said this, I should add that it is possible that something important has been lost in translation—that in speaking of impulses, desires, and aversions, Epicurus had in mind something different than we do.” This is a lost opportunity to go deeper.

* Not as strong when he dips into examples.

* E.g., He argues that Stoicism doesn’t mean we should be complacent about social injustices like slavery, even though slaves have the means of happiness in hand. This is actually controversial (see Kraut). But in any case, it seems to contract his later comments, misguided in my opinion, about ‘political correctness,’ which advises us to teach the disadvantaged better insults. I think that would be great, but this is a pretty inept handling of a complex issue, one that leaves readers who take it to hard worse off in their thinking about the subject.

* E.g., The practical advice about sex also strikes me as simplifying a vastly complicated realm of human experience in a way that’s not all that helpful.
