## **Alasdair Roberts, *The End of Protest: How Free-Market Capitalism Learned To Control Dissent***

[![The End of Protest](/media/book_covers/end_of_protest.jpg)](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100222390)

Periodic convulsions seem to be in the nature of capitalist economies. The
catastrophe of the Great Depression still looms so large in the popular
imagination that it's easy to forget that it was only one of many busts to
follow a boom. Collapse has always been accompanied by social upheaval,
sometimes of sufficient intensity to shake the very foundations of the system.
Our most recent economic catastrophe shuddered through the system in 2008, yet
 popular unrest was muted in comparison to previous crises. Why?

Aladair Roberts's *The End of Protest* is a look at this recent history through
a broader historical lens. He identifies four general strategies governments
might take to the social and economic upheaval: do nothing; repress protest;
contain it; appease it, by retreating from free market principles. Capitalist
governments have experimented with a mix of all four of these strategies at
different times.

Looks back to Schumpeter. Schumpeter argued that capitalism was inherently
unstable and warned, from the position of an advocate, that the flaw might
prove fatal.

The development of neoliberalism:

Myth of stable, efficient markets persisted up to 2008. The crisis proved that
neoliberals "had vastly underestimated the potential for unrest that laid
within the free-market model."

captures the ironies well. The neoliberal project of dismantling the social
safety net has not been completely successful---lucky for the neoliberal
project, since what remains of our safety net helped to contain unrest during
the crisis.

-The large city is New York
-novel of social criticism.
-As told to some distant future audience
-The general instability and scrounging of lives in a city dominated by the
-wealthy. The college debt and medical bill debt
-Not sure he had a clear conception of the audience

-p. 25 "Most people at this time ate meat. The opinion regarding the treatment
of animals by humans, in order of what was considered most evil to most
unremarkable, went: the ivory trade, which was the slaughter of elephants in a
distant land for their tusks; animal medical experimentation; the skinning and
wearing of fur; industrial meat farming; meat eating; dairy farms; petting
zoos; zoos; the eating of eggs; the drinking of milk; the keeping of household
pets."

p. 20: "Some people could achieve sexual intimacy with only one particular
gender. Most people are this time believed there were two of those. And many
believed these two genders were very distinct---almost separate species---and
so they should have different roles in life. Many, though, found this
ridiculous."

ground."

p. 145: "Chad was becoming Joni Mitchell-friends with Edward. That meant he'd

Kevin had grown an enormous brushy mustache. "I was saying, does this tear off?
And he got so upset! He was like, no, I just grew it." John said. "I was like,
it looks good, and he was like, okay."
"I'm going to take a vacation. I'm going to take like three days off next week.
Whatever," John said.

Had been looking forward to book; a little disappointing.

Moves too quickly over issues while lingering over other tangential issues
A little sloppy in places.

p.2: "A typical laptop can process about a trillion operations a second" (the
correct number, a billion, is given on p. 33)

p. 36: "Path, Trees and Flowers" should be Paths

p. 83 has Novosibirsk  1750 miles *West* of Moscow (or "west" uncapitalized).

p. 74: On halting problem: "no computer can look at some code of a program and
determine whether the code will run forever or eventually halt"  That seems
likely to mislead a beginner into thinking that there no program that could
inspect *any* program and determine whether it will halt. But of course there
are many, many programs that we can say will halt (e.g., print "hello world" in
Python). We could write a simple program to detect loops and then say with
confidence that such a program composed simply of non-looping statements will
halt after the execution of the statements. It seems important to explain that
we could always *craft* program input that will be impossible for a second
program to settle whether it will halt in a finite amount of time. 

p. 74 : "All programming languages are functionally equivalent, and all can
compute exactly what can be computed by the simple Turing machine." The word
"functionally" seems especially helpful here. Perhaps "effectively" would have
done the trick better. The fact that "all programming languages" is unexplained
is the real problem here. A beginning might wonder what makes a programming
language a full fledged programming language. E.g., why, the beginnger might
wonder, is html not a programming langauge but javascript is, when they both
use a bunch of funny text? (A good answer is that a programming language is a
fully fledged programming language when it is Turing complete, but now we've
closed a very tight circle). Fortnow punts on this issue, but it's a shame
since it matters to the book.

Book has a good overview of the stakes in N=NP, and some nice expository
passages.
