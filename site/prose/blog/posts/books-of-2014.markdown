## **Alasdair Roberts, *The End of Protest: How Free-Market Capitalism Learned To Control Dissent***

[![The End of Protest](/media/book_covers/end_of_protest.jpg)](http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100222390)

Periodic convulsions seem to be in the nature of capitalist economies. The
catastrophe of the Great Depression still looms so large in the popular
imagination that it's easy to forget that it was only one of many busts to
follow a boom. Collapse has always been accompanied by social upheaval,
sometimes of sufficient intensity to shake the very foundations of the system.
Our most recent economic catastrophe shuddered through the system in 2008, yet
 popular unrest was muted in comparison to previous crises. Why?

Aladair Roberts's *The End of Protest* is a look at this recent history through
a broader historical lens. He identifies four general strategies governments
might take to the social and economic upheaval: do nothing; repress protest;
contain it; appease it, by retreating from free market principles. Capitalist
governments have experimented with a mix of all four of these strategies at
different times.

Looks back to Schumpeter. Schumpeter argued that capitalism was inherently
unstable and warned, from the position of an advocate, that the flaw might
prove fatal.

The development of neoliberalism:

Myth of stable, efficient markets persisted up to 2008. The crisis proved that
neoliberals "had vastly underestimated the potential for unrest that laid
within the free-market model."

captures the ironies well. The neoliberal project of dismantling the social
safety net has not been completely successful---lucky for the neoliberal
project, since what remains of our safety net helped to contain unrest during
the crisis.

-wealthy. The college debt and medical bill debt
-Not sure he had a clear conception of the audience

-p. 25 "Most people at this time ate meat. The opinion regarding the treatment
of animals by humans, in order of what was considered most evil to most
unremarkable, went: the ivory trade, which was the slaughter of elephants in a
distant land for their tusks; animal medical experimentation; the skinning and
wearing of fur; industrial meat farming; meat eating; dairy farms; petting
zoos; zoos; the eating of eggs; the drinking of milk; the keeping of household
pets."

p. 20: "Some people could achieve sexual intimacy with only one particular
gender. Most people are this time believed there were two of those. And many
believed these two genders were very distinct---almost separate species---and
so they should have different roles in life. Many, though, found this
ridiculous."

And he got so upset! He was like, no, I just grew it." John said. "I was like,
it looks good, and he was like, okay."
"I'm going to take a vacation. I'm going to take like three days off next week.
Whatever," John said.

Had been looking forward to book; a little disappointing.

Moves too quickly over issues while lingering over other tangential issues
A little sloppy in places.

p.2: "A typical laptop can process about a trillion operations a second" (the
correct number, a billion, is given on p. 33)

p. 36: "Path, Trees and Flowers" should be Paths

p. 83 has Novosibirsk  1750 miles *West* of Moscow (or "west" uncapitalized).

p. 74: On halting problem: "no computer can look at some code of a program and
determine whether the code will run forever or eventually halt"  That seems
likely to mislead a beginner into thinking that there no program that could
inspect *any* program and determine whether it will halt. But of course there
are many, many programs that we can say will halt (e.g., print "hello world" in
Python). We could write a simple program to detect loops and then say with
confidence that such a program composed simply of non-looping statements will
halt after the execution of the statements. It seems important to explain that
we could always *craft* program input that will be impossible for a second
program to settle whether it will halt in a finite amount of time. 

p. 74 : "All programming languages are functionally equivalent, and all can
compute exactly what can be computed by the simple Turing machine." The word
"functionally" seems especially helpful here. Perhaps "effectively" would have
done the trick better. The fact that "all programming languages" is unexplained
is the real problem here. A beginning might wonder what makes a programming
language a full fledged programming language. E.g., why, the beginnger might
wonder, is html not a programming langauge but javascript is, when they both
use a bunch of funny text? (A good answer is that a programming language is a
fully fledged programming language when it is Turing complete, but now we've
closed a very tight circle). Fortnow punts on this issue, but it's a shame
since it matters to the book.

Book has a good overview of the stakes in N=NP, and some nice expository
passages.

## **Jo Walton, *My Real Children***

## **Art Spiegelman, *The Complete Maus: A Survivors Tale***
[![](/media/book_covers/complete_maus.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780679406419-0)

## **Michelle Alexander, *The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness ***
[![](/media/book_covers/new_jim_crow.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781595581037-20)

## **Charles Portis, *True Grit***

[![](/media/book_covers/true_grit.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781590204597-3)

## **Daniel Dennett, *Intuition Pumps and Other Tools For Thinking***

[![](/media/book_covers/intuition_pumps.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9780393348781-6)

Dennett eschews convention, including the convention about repeating your own
zingers (I can never resist either).

Much of Dennett's considerable firepower goes to attacking opponents for views
I find implausible. It might be profess hazzard of a software developer, but I
can't see what the mind might be besides some sort of fancy computing device.
Dualism bonkers.

I haven't read Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea," so I'm not sure. Even
though he is only concerned to attack views I find stupid, and defend many
views I find congenial, I suspect the focus might obscure other disagreements.
One thing Dennett does not do is try to guard against the stupider blunders
that naive but enthusiastic people who take themselves to be Darwinian do
(extrapolative ev psych, social Darwinism, esp. naively drawing oughts from
is's here).

## **Thomas Geoghegan, *Which Side Are You On? Trying to Be For Labor When It's Flat on its Back***

[![](/media/book_covers/which_side_are_you_on.jpg)](http://www.powells.com/biblio/61-9781565848863-2)

## **Laurie Penny, *Unspeakable Things: Sex, Lies and Revolution***

[![](/media/book_covers/.jpg)]()

p. 2: "This is a book about love and sex in austerity, about gender under
neoliberalism. 'Neoliberalism' refers to the attempt to reorganize society and
the state on the basis of an ideal of 'the market'. Neoliberalism proclaims
that the logic of business and money is the best determinant of human
happiness."

p. 5: "The feminism that has mattered to the media and made magazine headlines
in recent years has been the feminism most useful to heterosexual, high-earning
middle- and upper-middle-class white women. Public 'career feminists' have been
more concerned with getting more women into 'boardrooms', when the problem is
that there are altogether too many boardrooms, and none of them are on fire."

-p. 60 tries to broaden the scope: "Feminism has never just been about
 liberating women from men, but about freeing every human being from the
 straightjacket of gender oppression. For the first time, men and boys as a
 whole are starting to realize how profoundly messed up masculinity is---and to
 ask how they might make it different."

p. 75: two big secrets about traditional masculine power: "The first big secret
is this: most men have never really been powerful. Throughout human history,
the vast majority of men have had almost no structural power, except over women
and children. In fact, power over women and children---technical and physical
domininance wthin the sphere of one's own home---has been the sop offered to
men who had almost no power outside of it." The second secret is that many men
never fit the standard in the first place.

p. 89: "Miley Cyrus is castigated for being a poor role model, but Justin
Bieber can trash all the hotel rooms he likes. He's young. He'll learn."

p. 100: "Let's be perfectly clear: we have created a society in which it is
structurally difficult and existentially stressful for any male person not to
behave like a complete and utter arsehole."

-she stresses the non-zero sum nature of the interactions between men and
 women.

p. 122: "Sexual objectification doesn't get oppressive until it is done
consistently, and to a specific group of people, and with no regard whatsoever
paid to their humanity. Then it ceases to be about desire and starts to be
about control. . . Structural sexual objection [sic] of women draws that
instant out into an entire matrix of hurt. It tells us that women are bodies
first, idealised, subservient bodies, and men are not."

p. 195: on ev psych: "It's a eugenics of gender that would be seen for the
throat-closingly vile propaganda it is were the tests being done on people of
different races, ethnicities or sexual preferences. And yet these myths persist
because they are soothing, comforting, because they provide a halfway rational
basis for the prejudices that poison our society. . . Otherwise rational
individuals cling to bad science to justify the . . . .in the same way that
people once clung to religion to provide the same justification . . . This is,
apart from anything else, a terrible misuse of a respected theory."

-Writing is more passionate than focused (though occasionally comes into great
 focus, as with the passage on sexual objectification). Impressionistic,
 sweeping. Presenting the world as she sees it. Describing more than arguing.


## **Annie Dillard, *Teaching a Stone to Talk: Expeditions and Encounters***

[![](/media/book_covers/.jpg)]()

p. 9 (Total Eclipse) - "It had been like dying, that sliding down the mountain
pass. It had been like the death of someone, irrational, that sliding down the
mountain pass and into the region of dread. It was like slipping into fever, or
falling down that hole in sleep from which you wake yourself wimpering. We had
crossed the mountains that day, and now we were in a strange place---a hotel in
central Washington, in a town near Yakima. The eclipse we had traveled here to
see would occur early the next morning."

p. 24 (Total Eclipse) - "The mind wants to live forever, or to learn a very good reason why
not. The mind wants the world to return its love, or its awareness; the mind
wants to know all the world, and all eternity, and God. The mind's sidekick,
however, will settle for two eggs over easy.
"The dear, stupid body is as easily satisfied as a spaniel. And, incredibly,
the simple spaniel can lure the brawling mind to its dish. It is everlastingly
funny that the proud, metaphysically ambitious, clamoring mind will hush if you
give it an egg."

incantory, repetetive
rueful, tricks of memory.

p. 73 (In the Jungle): "The point of going somewhere like the Napo River in Ecuador is not to
see the most spectacular anyting. It is simply to see what is there. We are
here on the planet only once, and might as well get a feel for the place. We
might as well get a feel for the fringes and hollows in which live is lived,
for the Amazon basin, which covers half the continent, and for the life
that---there, like anywhere else---is always and necessarily lived in detail:
on the tributaries, in the riverside villages, scking this particular
white-fleshed guava in this particular pattern of shade."

Out of date on molecular genetics.

- p.175 (Aces and Eights) : "A ripple of wind comes down from the woods and
  across the clearing toward us. We see a wave of shadow and gloss where the
  short grass bends and the cottage eaves tremble. It hits us in the back. It
  is a single gust, a sport, a rogue breeze out of the north, as if some
  reckless, impatient wind has bumped the north door open on its hinges and let
  out this acre of scent familiar and forgotten, this cool scent of tundra, and
  of November. Fall! Who authorized this intrusion? Stop or I'll shoot. It is
  an entirely misplaced air---fall, that I have utterly forgotten, that could
  be here again, <em>another</em> fall, and here it is only July. I thought I
  was younger, and would have more time. The gust crosses the river and
  blackens the water where it passes, like a finger closing slats."
